She got out to open a metal gate that blocked her path .That\u2019s when she heard the whistle sounded by the driver of a train. Her Renault Clio was parked across a railway line. Seconds later, she watched the train drag her car almost a kilometre down the railway tracks.\nCeely\u2019s \nmade the news because she blamed it on her GPS (\u5bfc\u822a\u4eea). She had never driven the route before. It was dark and raining heavily. Ceely was relying on her GPS, but it made no mention of the crossing. \u201cI put my complete trust in the device and it led me right into the path of a speeding train,\u201d she told the BBC.\nWho is to blame here? Rick Stevenson, who tells Ceely\u2019s story in his book When Machines Fail Us, points the finger at the limitations of technology. We put our faith in digital devices, he says, but our digital helpers are too often not up to the job. They are filled with small problems. And it\u2019s not just GPS devices: Stevenson takes us on a tour of digital disasters involving everything from mobile phones to wireless keyboards.\nThe problem with his argument in the book is that it\u2019s not clear why he only focuses on digital technology, while there may be a number of other possible causes. A map-maker might have left the crossing off a paper map. Maybe we should blame Ceely for not paying attention. Perhaps the railway authorities are at fault for poor singalling system. Or maybe someone has studied the relative dangers and worked out that there really is something specific wrong with the GPS equipment. But Stevenson doesn\u2019t say.\nIt\u2019s a problem that runs through the book. In a section on cars, Stevenson gives an account of the advanced techniques that criminals use to defeat computer-based locking systems for cars. He offers two independent sets of figures on car theft; both show a small rise in some parts of the country. He says that once again not all new locks have proved reliable. Perhaps, but maybe it\u2019s also due to the shortage of policemen on the streets. Or changing social circumstances. Or some combination of these factors.\nThe game between humans and their smart devices is amusing and complex. It is shaped by economics and psychology and the cultures we live in. Somewhere in the mix of those forces there may be a way for a wiser use of technology.\nIf there is such a way, it should involve more than just an awareness of the shortcomings of our machines. After all, we have lived with them for thousands of years. They have probably been fooling us for just as long.\n\u5c0f\u98981:What did Paula Ceely think was the cause of her accident\uff1f\n\u5c0f\u98982:The phrase \u201cnear miss\u201d (Paragraph 2) can best be replaced by______.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following would Rick Stevenson most probably agree with?\n\u5c0f\u98984:In the writer\u2019s opinion, Stevenson\u2019s argument is _______.\n\u5c0f\u98985:What is the real concern of the writer of this article?\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n\u5c0f\u98985:B\n"},

And that has created a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one that\u2019s organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. \nConventionally grown food generally costs less, but is organic food a better choice? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and sold food products are now being debated on a large scale. Supporters of organic foods \u2015 a term whose meaning varies greatly \u2015are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. \nThe growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. \nAlmost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \u201cno-aging\u201d diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated(\u6ca1\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7684) reports that natural vitamins are superior to man-made ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than those treated with insect spray and the like. \nAlthough most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, large amounts of written material about the benefits of organic foods makes it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely advertised and form the basis for people\u2019s opinion. \nOne thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods. But in many cases consumers are misled if they believe organic foods can maintain health and provide better nutritional quality than conventionally grown foods. So there is real cause for concern if consumers, particularly those with limited incomes, distrust the conventional food supply and buy only expensive organic foods instead.\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to Paragraph 2, which of the following statements about organic food is true?\n\u5c0f\u98982:In Paragraph 4, treated grains are examples of ________. \n\u5c0f\u98983:It can be inferred from the passage that ________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:According to the passage, many consumers are attracted by organic foods because they _____.\n\u5c0f\u98985:What is the author\u2019s attitude towards the claims of organic foods?\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n"},

So far, he and his team have not succeeded, though they have cloned two cows and a cat.\nThey just might succeed in cloning Missy soon \u2014 or perhaps not for another five years.\nWesthusin's experience with cloning animals leaves him upset by all this talk of human cloning. In three years of work on the Missy project, using hundreds upon hundreds of dog's eggs, the A&M team has produced only a dozen or so embryos carrying Missy's DNA. None have survived the transfer to a surrogate\uff08\u4ee3\u5b55\u7684\uff09mother. The wastage of eggs and the many spontaneously aborted(\u6d41\u4ea7\uff0c\u53d1\u80b2\u4e0d\u5168) fetuses\uff08\u80ce\uff09may be acceptable when you're dealing with cats or bulls, he argues, but not with humans. \u201cCloning is incredibly inefficient, and also dangerous,\u201d he says.\nEven so, dog cloning is a commercial opportunity, with a nice research payoff. Ever since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996, Westhusin's phone has been ringing with people calling in hopes of duplicating their cats and dogs, cattle and horses. \u201cA lot of people want to clone pets, especially if the price is right,\u201d says Westhusin. Cost is no obstacle for Missy's mysterious billionaire owner; he's put up $3.7 million so far to fund A&M's research.\nContrary to some media reports, Missy is not dead. The owner wants a twin to carry on Missy's fine qualities after she does die. The prototype\uff08\u539f\u578b\uff1b\u96cf\u5f62\uff09is, by all accounts, athletic, good-natured and super-smart. Missy's master does not expect an exact copy of her. He knows her clone may not have her temperament\uff08\u6c14\u8d28\u3001\u6027\u60c5\uff09. In a statement of purpose, Missy's owner and the A&M team say they are \u201cboth looking forward to studying the ways that her clones differ from Missy.\u201d\nBesides cloning a great dog, the project may contribute insight into the old question of nature vs. nurture. It could also lead to the cloning of special rescue dogs and many endangered animals.\nHowever, Westhusin is cautious about his work. He knows that even if he gets a dog pregnant, the offspring, should they survive, will face the problems shown at birth by other cloned animals: abnormalities like immature lungs and heart and weight problems~ \u201cWhy would you ever want to clone humans,\u201d Westhusin asks, \u201cwhen we're not even close to getting it worked out in animals yet?\u201d\n\u5c0f\u98981:By \u201cstupid endeavor\u201d, Westhusin means to say that ________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does the second paragraph tell us about Westhusin's dog cloning project?\n\u5c0f\u98983:By cloning Missy, Mark Westhusin hopes to ________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:We learn from the passage that animal clones are likely to have ________.\n\u5c0f\u98985:What\u2019s the best title of the passage?\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n\u5c0f\u98985:B\n"},
