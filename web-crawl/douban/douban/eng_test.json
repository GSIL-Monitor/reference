She got out to open a metal gate that blocked her path .That\u2019s when she heard the whistle sounded by the driver of a train. Her Renault Clio was parked across a railway line. Seconds later, she watched the train drag her car almost a kilometre down the railway tracks.\nCeely\u2019s \nmade the news because she blamed it on her GPS (\u5bfc\u822a\u4eea). She had never driven the route before. It was dark and raining heavily. Ceely was relying on her GPS, but it made no mention of the crossing. \u201cI put my complete trust in the device and it led me right into the path of a speeding train,\u201d she told the BBC.\nWho is to blame here? Rick Stevenson, who tells Ceely\u2019s story in his book When Machines Fail Us, points the finger at the limitations of technology. We put our faith in digital devices, he says, but our digital helpers are too often not up to the job. They are filled with small problems. And it\u2019s not just GPS devices: Stevenson takes us on a tour of digital disasters involving everything from mobile phones to wireless keyboards.\nThe problem with his argument in the book is that it\u2019s not clear why he only focuses on digital technology, while there may be a number of other possible causes. A map-maker might have left the crossing off a paper map. Maybe we should blame Ceely for not paying attention. Perhaps the railway authorities are at fault for poor singalling system. Or maybe someone has studied the relative dangers and worked out that there really is something specific wrong with the GPS equipment. But Stevenson doesn\u2019t say.\nIt\u2019s a problem that runs through the book. In a section on cars, Stevenson gives an account of the advanced techniques that criminals use to defeat computer-based locking systems for cars. He offers two independent sets of figures on car theft; both show a small rise in some parts of the country. He says that once again not all new locks have proved reliable. Perhaps, but maybe it\u2019s also due to the shortage of policemen on the streets. Or changing social circumstances. Or some combination of these factors.\nThe game between humans and their smart devices is amusing and complex. It is shaped by economics and psychology and the cultures we live in. Somewhere in the mix of those forces there may be a way for a wiser use of technology.\nIf there is such a way, it should involve more than just an awareness of the shortcomings of our machines. After all, we have lived with them for thousands of years. They have probably been fooling us for just as long.\n\u5c0f\u98981:What did Paula Ceely think was the cause of her accident\uff1f\n\u5c0f\u98982:The phrase \u201cnear miss\u201d (Paragraph 2) can best be replaced by______.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following would Rick Stevenson most probably agree with?\n\u5c0f\u98984:In the writer\u2019s opinion, Stevenson\u2019s argument is _______.\n\u5c0f\u98985:What is the real concern of the writer of this article?\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n\u5c0f\u98985:B\n"},

And that has created a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one that\u2019s organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. \nConventionally grown food generally costs less, but is organic food a better choice? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and sold food products are now being debated on a large scale. Supporters of organic foods \u2015 a term whose meaning varies greatly \u2015are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. \nThe growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. \nAlmost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \u201cno-aging\u201d diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated(\u6ca1\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7684) reports that natural vitamins are superior to man-made ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than those treated with insect spray and the like. \nAlthough most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, large amounts of written material about the benefits of organic foods makes it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely advertised and form the basis for people\u2019s opinion. \nOne thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods. But in many cases consumers are misled if they believe organic foods can maintain health and provide better nutritional quality than conventionally grown foods. So there is real cause for concern if consumers, particularly those with limited incomes, distrust the conventional food supply and buy only expensive organic foods instead.\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to Paragraph 2, which of the following statements about organic food is true?\n\u5c0f\u98982:In Paragraph 4, treated grains are examples of ________. \n\u5c0f\u98983:It can be inferred from the passage that ________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:According to the passage, many consumers are attracted by organic foods because they _____.\n\u5c0f\u98985:What is the author\u2019s attitude towards the claims of organic foods?\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n"},

So far, he and his team have not succeeded, though they have cloned two cows and a cat.\nThey just might succeed in cloning Missy soon \u2014 or perhaps not for another five years.\nWesthusin's experience with cloning animals leaves him upset by all this talk of human cloning. In three years of work on the Missy project, using hundreds upon hundreds of dog's eggs, the A&M team has produced only a dozen or so embryos carrying Missy's DNA. None have survived the transfer to a surrogate\uff08\u4ee3\u5b55\u7684\uff09mother. The wastage of eggs and the many spontaneously aborted(\u6d41\u4ea7\uff0c\u53d1\u80b2\u4e0d\u5168) fetuses\uff08\u80ce\uff09may be acceptable when you're dealing with cats or bulls, he argues, but not with humans. \u201cCloning is incredibly inefficient, and also dangerous,\u201d he says.\nEven so, dog cloning is a commercial opportunity, with a nice research payoff. Ever since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996, Westhusin's phone has been ringing with people calling in hopes of duplicating their cats and dogs, cattle and horses. \u201cA lot of people want to clone pets, especially if the price is right,\u201d says Westhusin. Cost is no obstacle for Missy's mysterious billionaire owner; he's put up $3.7 million so far to fund A&M's research.\nContrary to some media reports, Missy is not dead. The owner wants a twin to carry on Missy's fine qualities after she does die. The prototype\uff08\u539f\u578b\uff1b\u96cf\u5f62\uff09is, by all accounts, athletic, good-natured and super-smart. Missy's master does not expect an exact copy of her. He knows her clone may not have her temperament\uff08\u6c14\u8d28\u3001\u6027\u60c5\uff09. In a statement of purpose, Missy's owner and the A&M team say they are \u201cboth looking forward to studying the ways that her clones differ from Missy.\u201d\nBesides cloning a great dog, the project may contribute insight into the old question of nature vs. nurture. It could also lead to the cloning of special rescue dogs and many endangered animals.\nHowever, Westhusin is cautious about his work. He knows that even if he gets a dog pregnant, the offspring, should they survive, will face the problems shown at birth by other cloned animals: abnormalities like immature lungs and heart and weight problems~ \u201cWhy would you ever want to clone humans,\u201d Westhusin asks, \u201cwhen we're not even close to getting it worked out in animals yet?\u201d\n\u5c0f\u98981:By \u201cstupid endeavor\u201d, Westhusin means to say that ________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does the second paragraph tell us about Westhusin's dog cloning project?\n\u5c0f\u98983:By cloning Missy, Mark Westhusin hopes to ________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:We learn from the passage that animal clones are likely to have ________.\n\u5c0f\u98985:What\u2019s the best title of the passage?\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n\u5c0f\u98985:B\n"},

The acts we now associate with vampires, such as rising \nfrom the grave and drinking blood, were popularized by Eastern European stories.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most early cultures created stories to explain things they didn't understand. For example, hair and nails\ncontinue to grow after people die, which has already been proved possible by modern science.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0These facts were unknown to most people in the 19th century, however. As a result, the legends \nsurrounding such mysteries were kept alive. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0In 1897, Irish writer Bram Stoker's novel Dracula was published, spreading the vampire stories to a mass\naudience. In the hovel, the Count Dracula of Transylvania, a 500-year-old vampire, has drunk his country\ndry and must move to England in search of new victims. Dracula means \"son of the dragon\" or \"son of the \ndevil\" in Romania. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The story of a half-man, half-wolf beast is as old as that of vampires, and almost as varied. In most \nwerewolf stories, however, a beast would silently enter settlements at night and steal a young child or an \nanimal. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The most common explanation of werewolf stories is that the beast was usually an ordinary wolf. The \ngenetic disorder, which causes too much body hair, may also have helped to popularize the story. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is a fictional scientist created by British writer Mary Shelly in 1818. Dr. Frankenstein lives m a castle\nand is so addicted to making living beings from parts of dead bodies that he refuses to marry. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The story of Frankenstein may have been planted in Shelly's mind since she visited Castle Frankenstein in\nGermany, where an alchemist (\u70bc\u672f\u58eb) tried to do experiments with the aim of making people live longer. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In H.G.Wells' 1897 story, a young scientist called Griffin, manages to make himself invisible. But he \ncannot find a way to become visible again. He then wants to make use of his super power but finally has\ngone mad. Wells' tale owes a great debt to Greek philosopher Plato's book Republic. \n1. The best title for this passage should be ____. \nA. Origins of Ghosts \nB. Tales of Horror \nC. Exciting Stories \nD.

Southeast Asians leave their poorer countries for their richer neighbours. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many of these wage-earners return in the end. In the meantime, they send home huge amounts of money-\nin the Philippines' case, over 10% of its GDP. Between January and November, the amount was up 18% on\nthe same period of 2005, Poverty and unemployment are still high in the Philippines and other labour-exporting\n(\u52b3\u52a1\u8f93\u51fa) countries. They would be far worse but for this outflow of bodies and inflow of dollars. As for\nthose Asian countries that import (\u8f93\u5165) labour, as in Europe, falling birth rates mean they are going to need \nmore foreign workers. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On January 13th leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed an agreement to \nhelp migrant (\u6d41\u52a8\u7684) workers-with the realization that the flow of labour between their countries is a growing \nproblem that they cannot blame on outsiders. A 2005 study showed that 8.4 million Southeast Asians worked \noutside their home countries, but this did not include the huge numbers of Indonesians doing so without papers.\nSo the true total is probably rather higher. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of the ten ASEAN countries, the Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos export\nlabour, Singapore and Brunei import it, and Thailand and Malaysia do both. Sziraczki of the UN's International\nLabour Organization points out that, in the next ten years, the total labour force of the worker exporting \ncountries should grow by about a third. It makes sense to work on the problem before it gets out of control. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People in the receiving countries seem to be worried about competition for their jobs. Most Thais said their\ngovernment should admit (\u51c6\u5165) no more foreign workers, and a few thought otherwise. Even in Singapore,\njust over ball of people are against admitting more foreign workers. Malaysians think that the increase in foreign\nworkers has worsened crime rates (\u72af\u7f6a\u7387). \n1. It can be inferred from the case of the Philippines that _____.\u00a0 \nA. the country is Asia's main source of migrant workers \nB. labour exports lead to a 10% growth of its GDP \nC. the outflow of labour helps solve its social problems \nD. the country both exports and imports labour force \n2. The flow of labour is a growing problem because _____. \nA. there is a greater flow of labour than reported \nB. more Indonesians work abroad without papers\nC. some countries suffer from low birth rates \nD. the ASEAN is against admitting foreign workers \n3. For the labour-importing countries, the flow of labour may lead to _____. \nA. higher birth rates \nB. lower crime rates \nC. greater money inflows \nD. stronger job competition \n4.

He added that kidult culture may fill the\ngeneration gap between adults and kids. It could give children and their parents books, movies, and \ncartoon shows to enjoy together.

I pulled out my phone to read a text message from my mom saying that we were\n leaving for Christmas shopping for him when I came across a message on my phone that I had locked. \nThe message was from my father. My eyes fell on a photo of a flower taken in Wyoming, and underneath \na poem by William Blake. The flower, a lone dandelion standing against the bright blue sky, inspired me. My dad had been reciting those words to me since I was a kid. That may even be the reason why I love \nwriting. I decided that those words would be my gift to my father.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I called back. I told my mom to go without me and that I already created my gift. I sent the photo of\n the cream-colored flower to my computer and typed the poem on top of it. As I was arranging the details another poem came to mind. The poem was written by Edgar Allan Poe; my dad recited it as much as he \ndid the other. I typed that out as well and searched online for a background to the words of \n. The poem was focused around dreaming, and after searching I found the perfect picture. The image was painted with blues and greens and purples, twisting together to create the theme and wonder of a dream. As I watched both poems passing through the printer, the white paper coloring with words that shaped my childhood, I\n felt that this was a gift that my father would truly appreciate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Christmas soon arrived. The minute I saw the look on my dad's face as he unwrapped those swirling \nblack letters carefully placed in a cheap frame, I knew I had given the perfect gift.\n1. \u00a0The idea for a special gift began to form when the author was _________.\nA. doing shopping\nB. having a debater\nC. reading a message\nD. leaving for Wyoming\n2.

The author made the gift by _________.\nA. searching for the poems online\nB. drawing the background by hand\nC. painting the letters in three colors\nD. matching the words with pictures\n5.

In four days it destroyed more than three-quarters of the old city, where most of the houses were wooden and close together. One hundred thousand people became homeless, but only a few lost their lives.\n The fire started on Sunday morning in the house of the King's baker(\u9762\u5305\u5e08)in Pudding Lane, The baker, with his wife and family, was able to get out through a window in the roof. A strong wind blew the fire from the bakery(\u623f)into a small hotel next door. Then it spread quickly into Thames Street. That was the beginning.\n By eight o'clock three hundred houses were on fire. On Monday nearly a kilometer of the city was burning along the River Thames. Tuesday was the worst day. The fire destroyed many well-known buildings, old St Paul's and the Guildhall among them.\n Samuel Pepys, the famous writer, wrote about the fire. People threw their things into the river. Many poor people stayed in their houses until the last moment. Birds fell out of the air because of the heat.\n The fire stopped only when the King finally ordered people to destroy hundreds of buildings in the path of the fire. With nothing left to burn, the fire became weak and finally died out.\n After the fire, Christopher Wren, the architect(\u5efa\u7b51\u5e08), wanted a city with wider streets and fine new houses of stone.

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were amazing not only because of their beauty, but also because of their location.\n In the 7\n century BC a king named Nebudchadnezzar II created the gardens as a sign of love for his wife, Amyitis. According to legend, Amyitis, the daughter of the king of the Medes, was homesick. She missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland.\n Upon marrying Nebudchadnezzar II, Amyitis moved to the ancient chief city of Babylon. The area was in the Mesopotamian desert, and the climate there was totally different from where she had left. So the new queen was very sad about the flat and the sun-baked desert. To make Amyitis happier and more comfortable the king decided to build her a series of magnificent gardens.\n Many think of the gardens as an otherworldly creation that hung in the air somehow. But experts agree that the gardens were actually built on a mountainside, rather than actually \u201changing\u201d.\n The hanging Gardens of Babylon are famous. Stories of them spread throughout the ancient world, and ancient writers recorded a large number of descriptions of the gardens, but some wonder whether this paradise of the past ever existed. There are no historical records of it except stories. Whatever may happen, even the idea of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is amazing.

Soon in the same year Sudoku became popular in Japan. In November 2004, The Times, a British newspaper, first printed it in the newspaper. It became an international hit in 2005.

Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements.\n Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a \n saying that he has been given the prize.

Old-timers used it to describe a man who had just arrived from one of the big cities in the east. The greenhorn didn\u2019t have the skills that he would need to live in the hard, rough country.\nSomeone who has the ability to grow plants well is said to have a green thumb. The expression comes from the early nineteen hundreds.\nA person with a green thumb seems to have a magic touch that makes plants grow quickly and well. You might say that the woman next door has a green thumb if her garden continues to grow long after your plants have died.\nThe Green Revolution (\u9769\u547d) is the name which was given some years ago to the development of new kinds of rice and other grains. The new plants produced much larger crops. The Green Revolution was the result of hard work by agricultural (\u519c\u4e1a\u7684) scientists who had green thumbs.\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to the passage, a greenhorn means________ now.\n\u5c0f\u98982:The meaning of the underlined word \u201cripe\u201d in the second paragraph is ________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following about the Green Revolution is NOT right?\n\u5c0f\u98984:We can know from the passage that _______.\n\u5c0f\u98985:The main idea of the passage is ________.\n"},

Honouring a 62-year-old tradition, the President pardoned(\u8d66\u514d)the bird on Thanksgiving eve.\nThe tradition of a turkey pardon at Thanksgiving began with President Truman in 1947. Courage comes from Ellsworth, Iowa. The name Courage was chosen by voters (\u6295\u7968\u4eba)who took part in a survey posted on the White House website. The lucky turkey walked on the lawn of the Rose Garden and posed for the cameras at the presidential podium(\u8bb2\u53f0).\nThe dinner that has become known as the First Thanksgiving was actually a harvest festival celebrated in December of 1621. That\u2019s when English settlers in Plymouth, Massachusetts, gave thanks for the progress they had made after a hard winter in their new country. As America grew, Thanksgiving customs also spread and got bigger. George Washington declared that the first national Thanksgiving would be on November 26, 1789. In the decades to follow, however, people celebrated Thanksgiving locally, with no official date. President Abraham Lincoln declared the last Thursday in November 1863 a national day of Thanksgiving. It stayed that way until 1939, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved it one week earlier. He wanted to lengthen the shopping period before Christmas to encourage gift-buyers and to help businesses. So Congress\uff08\u8bae\u4f1a\uff09 ruled that, after 1941, Thanksgiving would be an official federal holiday falling on the fourth Thursday of November.\nThis year we celebrated Thanksgiving on Thursday, November. Millions of Americans got together to give thanks with friends and family. The lucky turkey, Courage, was one of them. After his pardon, Courage would be sent to Disneyland Resort in California, where he would be the grand assemble of Disney\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade.\nThat the turkey Courage was pardoned was decided by ________.\n The first Thanksgiving Day was held to ________.\n We can infer(\u63a8\u65ad)from the passage that ________.\n"},

It seems that it is very important in our life. That\u2019s because without money you can\u2019t buy any goods(\u5546\u54c1) you want. But I think few people know the history of money.\nLong ago, people did not need money. They lived on wild animals, fruits and other plants. As time passed, people learned to raise animals and crops. Sometimes, families produced more than they needed, so they started to trade with other families. Later, people began to use money as a means of exchange. However, it was not the kind of money we use today. They used shells, rice, salt, large stones, etc.\nDuring the 600s BC, people began using coins as money. They soon found that coins were easier to carry than goods and lasted a long time. Later, countries began to make their own coins.\nThe Chinese were the first to use paper money, probably as early as the 11\n century. The Italian traveler Marco Polo saw the Chinese using money when he visited China in the 1200s. However, European countries did not start using paper money until 1600s.\nToday, we have many ways to pay for things. We do not use coins or paper money.

Such an ad is about feelings rather than facts.\nAds are full of strong words, and words like \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cimproved\u201d have power. They can help a produce sell.

Take time to think.\nAll ads hope we will buy something, do something, or think in a certain way. Know what ads are doing. Ask questions to yourself.

At the age of four, I started speech lessons because even I could not speak well enough to be understood.\nFirst grade was a struggle. I not only had difficulty speaking, but I was expected to learn to read and I just couldn't do it. My parents grew more and more frustrated. They bought books and offered great rewards if I could read one of them from start to finish to them. Well, with my speech problems and now my reading problems, I did not like to do reading and so refused to do it whenever possible.\nSecond grade was not much better. It was in the second grade that the teacher decided that I needed special education. I remember the days of taking the physical exams. However, after all that, they decided that I did not qualify for special education.\nIt was in third grade that a new school was built close to where I lived. I remember going there with my parents and helping to get the school ready so that we could transfer(\u8f6c\u5b66). It was a happy day that we started school at Vandalia. However, things did not get better as my parent expected.\nIt was now time for fifth grade. Mrs. Wakefield was my teacher, and if ever there was a teacher that deserved a gold star, it was her. She did not make me feel upset. Instead, she helped me in so many ways and built my self-confidence so that I actually did believe that I could do something special. And that is just what I did.\nFor the past 22 years, I have been a fifth grade teacher. Because of Mrs. Wakefield's influence in my life, I am now encouraging students who have had difficulties in their lives to believe that they can overcome and become someone. I have won a large number of awards but I know that all of them belong to one fifth grade teacher who believed in me and challenged me to be all that I could be.\nI still have a class picture of her with her fifth grade class hanging on the wall of my office, encouraging other teachers to reach out to their students.\n\u5c0f\u98981: What does the underlined phrase \u201camount to much\u201d mean in Paragraph l?\n\u5c0f\u98982:From the second paragraph we know that______________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:What can we infer from the passage?\n\u5c0f\u98984:In which grade did the turning point in writer's life appear?\n\u5c0f\u98985:.What can we learn from the passage?\n"},

Someone who is born today can expect to live 25 years longer than someone who was born in the 19th century. It's even thought that in the future more and more people will celebrate their hundredth birthday. Here are five rules for a healthy life.\n\u5c0f\u98981:\nWe all know that we shouldn't run across the road in front of the oncoming traffic, or cycle too close to cars. But we\u2019re not sure about how to stay safe in the countryside. When you're out walking you should always go with someone. and tell your parents where you're planning to go. Remember! Climbing may also mean falling-what goes up must come down. Safety rules and advice are there to help you, not to make life less fun.\n\u5c0f\u98982:\nSure, it's comfortable to sit on the couch and watch. But experts say you should walk at least 10,000 steps every day to keep fit. In the past, People's jobs required more physical effort. When farmers were working in the fields, they were keeping fit at the same time. Think about it: do you get the same amount of exercise today as they did in the past?\n\u5c0f\u98983:\nIt's important to eat plenty of the right things, above all, fruit, vegetables, and to see fast food or sweets as something very special- maybe just and then. The wrong diet means you'll put on weight, one of the fastest ways to an unhealthy life.\n\u5c0f\u98984:\nWhen we were babies, we slept for much of the day- if our parents were lucky! Teenagers don't need as much sleep but it's important to get about eight hours' sleep. At weekends, you've got more time, so use it not just for your friends, but for rest, too.\n\u5c0f\u98985:\nYes, you knew I was going to say this! But\u00a0it's so important. More teenagers damage their health through smoking and taking drugs than any other dangers. Think about the effect on your family and friends, and think about its effect on you and your health.\nE. Watch your diet!\nF. Don't be a couch potato!\n"},

Left in a bank it will hardly keep its value, however high the interest rate. Only a brave man, or a very rich one, dares to buy and sell on the Stock Market. Today it seems that one of the best ways to protect your savings, and even increase your wealth is to buy beautiful objects from the past. Here I am going to offer some advice on collecting antique clocks, which I personally consider are among the most interesting of antiques.\nI sometimes wonder what a being from another planet might report back about our way of life. \"The planet Earth is ruled by a mysterious creature that sits or stands in a room and makes a strange ticking sound. It has a face with twelve black marks and two hands. Men can do nothing without its permission, and it fastens its young round people's wrists so that everywhere men go they are still under its control. This creature is the real master of Earth and men are its slaves\uff08\u5974\u96b6\uff09.\"\nWhether or not we are slaves of time today depends on our culture and personality, but it is believed that many years ago kings kept special slaves to tell the time. Certain men were very clever at measuring\uff08\u91cf\uff09 the time of clay according to the beating of their own hearts. They were made to stand in a fixed place and every hour or so would shout tire time. So it seems that the first clocks were human beings.\nHowever, men quickly found more convenient and reliable\uff08\u53ef\u9760\u7684\uff09 ways of telling the time. They learned to use the shadows cast by the sun. They marked the hours on candles, used sand in hour- glasses, and invented water-clocks. Indeed, any serious student of antique should spend as much time as possible visiting palaces, stately homes and museums to see some of the finest examples of clocks from the past.\nAntique clocks could be very expensive, but one of the joys of collecting clocks is that it is still possible to find quite cheap ones for your own home. After all, if you are going to be ruled by time, why not invest in air antique clock and perhaps make a future profit\uff08\u6536\u76ca\uff09?\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to the passage, collecting antique clocks____.\n\u5c0f\u98982:By quoting (\u5f15\u7528) the remark of a being from another planet, the author intends to____.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following is NOT mentioned as a way to measure the time?\n\u5c0f\u98984:The underlined phrase stately homes in paragraph\uff08\u6bb5\u843d\uff094 means_________.\n\u5c0f\u98985:The purpose of the passage is________.\n"},

So I went on the net, spent 15 minutes reading product reviews on good websites, wrote down the names of three top recommendations (\u63a8\u8350) and headed for my nearest big camera store. There in the cupboard was one of the cameras on my list. And it was on special offer. Oh joy. I pointed at it and asked a salesgirl, \u201cCan I have one of those?\u201d \u201cDo you want to try it first?\" she said. It didn\u2019t quite sound like a question. \u201cDo I need to?\u201d I replied. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it?\u201d \u201cNo, no. But you should try it,\u201d she said encouragingly. \u201cCompare it with the others.\u201d\nI looked across at the others: shelves of similar cameras placed along the wall, offering different prices. With so many models to choose from, it seemed that I would have to spend hours weighing X against Y, always trying to consider Z and possibly H at the same time. But when I had finished, I would still have only the same two certainties that I had entered the store with: first, soon after I carried my new camera out of the shop, \n; and second, my wonderful camera would very quickly be replaced by a new model.\nBut something in the human soul whispers that you can beat these traps (\u9677\u9631) by making the right choice. In the end, I agreed to try the model I had chosen. The salesgirl seemed a kind girl. So I let her take out my chosen camera from the cupboard, show how it took excellent pictures of my fellow shoppers... and when she started to introduce the special features, I cut in to ask whether I needed to buy a carry-case and a memory card as well.\nWhy do we think that new choices still offer us anything new? Perhaps it is because they offer a chance to avoid facing the fact that our real choices in this culture are far more limited than we would like to imagine.\n\u5c0f\u98981:The salesgirl insisted that the writer should ______.\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does the writer mean by \u201c\n\u201d?\n\u5c0f\u98983:The writer decided to try the model he had chosen because he ______.\n\u5c0f\u98984: It can be inferred from the passage that in the writer\u2019s opinion, ______.\n"},

Nearly 300 birds were killed during the competition, leaving a crime scene of feathers and blood. This is the only event in Olympic history that involved killing live animals.\nKabaddi (1936)\nThis sport is popular in South Asia. The object is for one member of a team to enter the other side\u2019s half of the field, and score points. The attacker then returns to his half of the field.\n12 Hour Bicycle Race (1896)\nSeven riders got on their bikes at 5 a.m. and rode until 5 p.m. Four riders dropped out before noon, but the winner, Adolf Schmal of Austria, managed about 180 miles. Only Schmal and one other finished.\nTug of War (1900\u20141920)\nThis may seem like a basic PE class sport more than an Olympic event, but Tug of War was actually one of the first sports played at the Olympic games in 500 BC.\nThere are two teams of eight; the winning team must pull the other team six feet forward.\nSwimming Obstacle Race (1900)\nThe athletes had to climb over a pole (\u6746\u5b50) and a row of boats, and then swim under another row of boats. All of this was done in the Seine River, so they also had to fight against the water. This event was only ever held in 1900, in Paris.\n\u5c0f\u98981:What do you probably think of these events?\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which sport looks like a common activity more than an Olympic event?\n\u5c0f\u98983:How many athletes finished the event 12 Hour Bicycle Race?\n\u5c0f\u98984:What does \u201cdrop out\u201d mean in English according to the passage?\n\u5c0f\u98985:What can we learn from the passage?\n"},

But the feeling of the sand under their feet, the salt water on their skin, and the warm sun on their backs make them happier.\n\u5c0f\u98981:Every year, school children have the final exams in ____, and the exam means the school year will end.\n\u5c0f\u98982:According to the passage, if a child comes from a big city, he can often ____ in the summer holidays.\n\u5c0f\u98983: It\u2019s the best way for children to go to the ____ to spend their summer holidays.\n\u5c0f\u98984: ____ make children like the seaside so much?\n\u5c0f\u98985: Which of the following is Not true according to the passage?\n"},

I hope you have enjoyed the performance. As you may know, all the performers have given their time to help us.\n This concert is to raise money for children in Africa. Every day hundreds of children in Africa die because they don\u2019t have enough to eat. There are two reasons. First, there is no work for the children\u2019s parents. Second, the governments in many African countries do not have the money to help the poor.\n Most African countries are poor. The land is not good for growing food and the weather is also bad for farming. The Feed Africa Fund spends millions of dollars every year on food for poor people in Africa. This money comes from people like you---- kind, \n people who do not want to see children die from hunger.\n Every dollar you give this evening will go to the Feed Africa Fund. Just one dollar can buy enough food to feed a family of four for three days. Think about it: only one dollar can feed four people for three days.\n How much do you spend on food every day? Ten dollars? Twenty dollars? I am sure you can spend a little less on your own food so that you have a few dollars for the Feed Africa Fund.\n Please be kind and generous! Give your money with a helping hand. Your money can make a difference in others\u2019 life and yours. Thank you!\nIn the speech , the biggest problem in many African countries is______.\nThe speaker is trying to help the audience believe that__________.\nThe Chinese meaning for \u201cgenerous\u201d is ______.\nThe Feed Africa Fund is a(n)_______.\nIf a person gives five dollars, the money will be able to feed four people for ______.\n"},

First, you need to know about audience manners.\nMost sporting arenas(\u7ade\u6280\u573a)have rules for audience written on the back of the tickets. Read your ticket carefully before you arrive. Try to reach your seat half an hour before the start of the event and don\u2019t leave when a game is in progress. When you leave, remember to take away your soft drink bottles and other rubbish.\nDuring exciting games, try to control yourself. Don\u2019t criticize the performance of players and coaches. Be careful with your words, since some may cause anger among other people in the audience.\nClapping is a special form of body language you can use to communicate with players, but you should do it properly. When players first appear, clap your hands together to welcome them, but don\u2019t go on for too long. After an excellent performance, clap warmly. If someone fails, your clapping will help encourage them.\nClapping is not welcome, however, while players need to keep their attention. Various sports have various rules for the audience.\nEnjoying artistic gymnastics silence. But lots of cheering can really help basketball and football players. When you watch snooker and table tennis matches, flash photography is not allowed. Mobile phones are not allowed in shooting centers.\nTo be a good audience, you should take time to learn the game\u2014particular rules and related culture of each event.\nTitle: Good Audience Manners\n"},

You have no power and could do nothing that helps change the situation. However, you can have great power over what happens to you if you stop focusing on whom to blame and start focusing on how to \n the situation. This is the winner\u2019s key to success.\nWinners are great at solving problems. For example, if you were late because your car broke down, maybe you need to have your car examined more regularly. Or, you might start to carry along with you the useful phone numbers, so you could call for help when in need. For another example, if your colleague (\u540c\u4e8b) causes you problems on the job for being short of responsibility or ability, find ways of dealing with his irresponsibility or inability rather than simply blame the person. Ask to work with a different person, or don\u2019t depend on the person. You should accept that the person is not reliable and find creative ways to work successfully regardless of how your colleague fails to do his job well.\nThis is what being a winner is all about \u2013 creatively using your skills and talents so that you are successful no matter what happens. Winners don\u2019t have fewer problems in their lives; they have just as many difficult situations to face as anybody else.

Most people know that all the other birds do as well. But have you ever thought about other animals that lay eggs? They include bees, snakes and some sea animals. When a mother lays eggs, many more babies can be born at once, or in a few days, because there is very little development inside the parent. Animals that do not lay eggs often have fewer babies. Animals lay many eggs because other animals may eat the babies. However, even though some of their babies are eaten, they will still have some more to continue their family.\n Some animals that lay eggs do not take care of their young. Turtles come onto the beach and dig holes. Then they put their eggs in the sand and leave. A turtle mother can lay as many as 150 eggs. When the babies come out of the eggs, they must find their own way to the ocean. They must learn how to live on their own. Many young turtles get eaten by other animals.\n Most eggs have an outside shell that keeps the growing animal inside safe. The egg shell\u00a0also keeps the young animal from drying out. After the animal is fully developed, it comes out of the egg.\n The animal grows bigger and bigger.

Courage is challenging yourself to do something even though you think it might be hard. For each promise, find out two or three ways to help you keep it. For example, if you think that Being Honest is the hardest promise for you to keep, one of the ways might be \u201cTell people about my promise so that I won\u2019t break it\u201d.\nPart 3: Confidence\nConfidence is believing that you have the skills to do something. Do you have a beautiful singing voice? Are you a good painter? There are all talents that can make you feel good, as well as the people around you.

They could see the moon was made of rocks. Most scientists thought moon rocks would be different from those on the earth. This was because they believed the moon had once been a planet that had been caught in the earth\u2019s gravity millions of years earlier.\nIn 1969, moon rocks werefinally brought to the earth and studied.

Once again new ideas were needed for this new information.\nAfter years of study, most scientists now think that the moon was once part of the earth. They believe very early in its history, maybe 4 billion years ago, something about the size of Mars hit the earth. This sent billions of rocks into space around our planet. These rocks slowly joined together and after many years became the moon.\nIn the future, even thought our ideas about the moon may change again, we will still be interested in it.\n\u5c0f\u98981:2000 years ago, people already knew_____.\n\u5c0f\u98982:Before 1969, most scientists thought the moon was_____.\n\u5c0f\u98983:After years of study, most scientists now think_____.\n\u5c0f\u98984:From this passage we can learn that_____.\n"},

Many cultures believed that comets were messages sent by gods, and people thought these messages were warning signs for bad behavior. But today science and technology give us a better understanding of comets.\nLast week, comet Ison ended its million-year-long journey as it flew straight toward the sun, melting most of the comet. It was hoped that comet Ison would survive this trip around the sun. Because once it got near Earth, it would have produced a great show of lights for us.\nIn ancient times, the coming of comet Ison might have scared people. However, now we can track a comet\u2019s journey in our solar system. We can also study what they\u2019re made of. There is even a project to launch a spacecraft onto a comet to study them further.\nAlthough from the sky they look like great giant fireballs, comets are a collection of gas, ice, dust and small rocks. As a comet goes into our solar system, the sun\u2019s solar winds blow some of the dust and gas away, giving the comet a tail. The average size of comets is about 10 kilometers in diameter(\u76f4\u5f84). But amazingly, their tails can be 150 kilometers long! Comet Ison\u2019s diameter was about 5 kilometers.\nToday, people don\u2019t fear comets as much as they did before. Western countries have even developed and old tradition. When people see a comet or meteoroid(\u6d41\u661f) shooting across the sky, they call it a shooting star, People who get the chance to see one get to make a wish.

You don't have to give your \nlunch money or your clothes, of course. Instead you share your ideas and feelings. These can be valuable \n(\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684) to a friend. They tell your friend what is important to you. By sharing them, you help your friends \nknow you better. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sooner or late everyone needs understanding and help with a problem. Something may go wrong at \nschool. Talking about the problem can make it easier to solve. Turning to a friend can be a first step in \nsolving the problem. So to be a friend you must listen and understand. You must try to put yourself in your\nfriend's place, so you can understand the problem better.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No two friendships are ever exactly alike.

Could it just be a common cold or the flu (\u6d41\u611f) that\u2019s been going around?\nA cold gives you a runny nose and cough. But it\u2019s usually easy to deal with. Some take medicine while others drink herbal tea or chicken soup. Usually you feel better after a week.\nOn the other hand, the flu can be much more dangerous. It usually gives you fever. Sometimes it can cause death. According to an American magazine, the worst flu killed about 50 million people from 1918 to 1919.\nDon\u2019t worry. If you get a flu vaccine (\u75ab\u82d7), it can stop you from getting the virus (\u75c5\u6bd2). Flu vaccines work by giving the body a small amount of flu viruses. This causes your body to develop antibodies (\u6297\u4f53). So next time you get the flu, the antibodies should help you.\nThe flu virus changes every few years. Therefore, there are so many types of flu, such as H1N1 and H5N1. The antibodies for one type of flu can\u2019t help us against all types of flu. That\u2019s why we need to get the vaccine every year.\nHowever, good health habits may also help stop you developing a cold or flu. Washing your hands often helps stop you from getting viruses.

Actually, though,\nwe know that this is not true. But we still wonder where that strange feeling comes from.\nIn fact, this is one of the ways that we're tricked by time, according to the website All That Is Interesting. The website lists several wrong impressions we often have about time. Let's have a look.\nFirst of all, emotions affect our time-keeping abilities: Negative emotions, especially anxiety and boredom, make time seem longer because they make us concentrate more on the passage of time. However, when we are enjoying ourselves, we pay more attention to what we are doing and are likely to lose track of\uff08\u5931\u53bb\u5bf9\u2026.\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\uff09 time.\nHere is another example. In 2007, a group of scientists carried out a test. In the test, people fell 50 meters into a safety net and were then asked about their experience. Although the experience took shorter than 3 seconds, the people thought it was much longer than it actually was.\nThis is because of the way our bodies reply to danger, according to the scientists. Our bodies produce a chemical called adrenaline (\u80be\u4e0a\u817a\u7d20) when we are faced with danger. It allows us to concentrate better so that we can stay alive. As a result, we are able to remember far more details(\u7ec6\u8282)over a short period of time, which makes it seem like time is going more slowly.\nAnother situation when we make mistakes about time is when we take afternoon naps\uff08\u5348\u89c9\uff09\uff0e Have you ever had trouble telling what time it is after a long nap? That's because the best amount of time for a nap is 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, you enter a new stage of sleep called slow-wave sleep. If you wake up mid-way in this stage, it will take a while before you can correctly perceive\uff08\u611f\u77e5\uff09 time again.\nYes, time can be mysterious and there is no way to control it So, perhaps the best thing to do is to make good use of every minute.\n\u5c0f\u98981: According to the passage, what possibly makes people feel so long ?\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which is NOT the wrong impressions that we often have about time according to the website listing?\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, in which situation do we make mistakes about time?\n\u5c0f\u98984:According to the passage , what will NOT happen when we are faced with danger ?\n\u5c0f\u98985:Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage ?\n"},

But during last semester's final exams, his math score was only 90 points.\nIt was a shock. \"I didn't know what happened,\" said Lin, who kept feeling nervous and frustrated about math during the following month.\nLike Lin, many of us have setbacks (\u632b\u6298) in life. What would you do to deal with these setbacks? Would you just let them be and give up?\nLin chose to face his problem. His parents and teacher also gave him help.

Although he still isn't at his original (\u539f\u6765\u7684) level, Lin doesn't panic anymore.\n\"Don't be scared by setbacks,\" he said. \"You will beat it.\"\nChen Xingzhu in Shenzhen also has a story to tell. The 15-year-old girl is not good at doing sit-ups (\u4ef0\u5367\u8d77\u5750), which is necessary for the coming high school PE entrance exam. One has to do at least 35 sit-ups in a minute to pass the test. Most of Chen's classmates can do 40. However, Chen could only do 20.\nFeeling worried, Chen decided to do something. She did sit-ups for half an hour every day after school.

He offered her some water and then asked her what was \n.\n The woman said that her husband had died and she didn\u2019t have anyone else in her family who could \n\u00a0her. she did some manual(\u4f53\u529b\u7684) labor to earn some money to \n\u00a0her daughter but she was sick for the last three days and was \nto go to work. Now she didn\u2019t have a grain of food to eat. While she was telling this story to my father, she was unable to \nher emotions\uff08\u60c5\u7eea\uff09and started crying again. My father and I were deeply \nby her story.\n We got some food for her and her baby. My father then took them to the nearest hospital for her baby to be \n\u00a0as she did not seem to be very well. On the way, we\u00a0\n\u00a0her a 5kg-bag of wheat from the market. My father gave her some money before we left. The lady was so \n.\n It is eight years later,\nthat event is still very\nto this woman moved me \nand since then, I have decided to try and walk a similar path and serve others. I\u2019m \nto see so many other people in this world are also ready to help others when they meet people \n. They have\n\u00a0to walk a service path also.\n"},

It represented a wide range of music\u00a0 39\u00a0 \u2014\u2014I certainly wasn\u2019t narrow\u2014minded.

Fliers who check in early are the least likely to get bumped from oversold flights.\nTake it public\nThe rates for renting a car at the airport have more than doubled over the past year because rental lot inventories(\u5730\u4ea7) have increased dramatically.

Unable to speak English but willing to do anything to succeed, he learned the language, and became a barber. He put his two daughters, my sister and me, through college during a time when most people thought that women didn\u2019t need an education and that they should be satisfied by getting married and having children.\nI was preparing to get married and my father was trying to practice the polka, a must at any Ukrainian wedding. But he couldn\u2019t do it! He had lost the mobility\uff08\u6d3b\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff09in his leg and suffered a brain \n\uff08\u7624\uff09. He was forced to retire as a result of paralysis\uff08\u762b\u75ea\uff09of his right arm and leg. Dad had always worked two jobs and spent his spare time working around the house. Now his life came to a sudden stop. Yet never once did he complain. He bought rubber balls and spent his days trying to regain his hand mobility by squeezing those balls over and over.\nAfter his second brain operation, he chatted pleasantly in the hospital room until a nurse flew into the room, waving her finger at me, and yelling, \u201cYou\u2019d better tell your father to stay in bed. He is paralyzed and will never walk again. I am sick of picking him up and you\u2019d better warn him to stay put!\u201d My father smiled. He spent a great deal of time on the floor that year, but he eventually got up and walked.\nMy father lived nineteen more years after that second brain operation. He bought himself a motorized scooter\uff08\u5355\u811a\u6ed1\u884c\u8f66\uff09and spent years moving around the streets of Philadelphia. He was proud, free and always smiling.\n56.In what way was the father different from most other people in his time?\nA. He succeeded immigrating to the US.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nB.

He gained much\u00a0\u00a0 36\u00a0\u00a0 while traveling throughout the world. Unfortunately he lost his legs and left arm in a tragic accident, leaving only a finger and thumb on his right hand. He became so\u00a0\u00a0 37\u00a0\u00a0 that he was afraid he would spend his life\u00a0\u00a0 38\u00a0\u00a0 and would no longer be able to use his life in a(n)\u00a0\u00a0 39\u00a0\u00a0 way.\nOne day, he remembered how he had always loved getting\u00a0\u00a0 40\u00a0 . He realized that he still had partial\u00a0\u00a0 41\u00a0\u00a0 of his right hand and could write with\u00a0\u00a0 42\u00a0 . Then, he had an idea. \u201cWhy not write to other people who need encouragement?\u201d\nHe\u00a0\u00a0 43\u00a0\u00a0 where he could find those who could be encouraged if they read his letters. He thought of people in\u00a0\u00a0 44\u00a0 . Many of them had hope of regaining their\u00a0\u00a0 45\u00a0 . Others would keep feeling depressed and remain put away for the rest of their lives. He decided that he must try to\u00a0\u00a0 46\u00a0\u00a0 them. So he wrote to a prison ministry about sending letters to the prisoners. The prison minister replied that writing to the prisoners would be\u00a0\u00a0 47\u00a0 . However, it would be against prison rules for the prisoners to write back.\n48\u00a0\u00a0 with the intention, the man began sending\u00a0\u00a0 49\u00a0\u00a0 messages of God\u2019s love, hope, strength, and encouragement. He wrote twice a week, testing his strength and ability to the\u00a0\u00a0 50\u00a0 . He poured his heart and soul into his words,\u00a0\u00a0 51\u00a0\u00a0 his experience, sense of humor, optimism, and faith.\nIt was difficult to write those letters, especially without hope of any\u00a0\u00a0 52\u00a0 . Frequently, he felt discouraged, wondering if anyone\u00a0\u00a0 53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 read his letters. However, this was his\u00a0\u00a0 54\u00a0\u00a0 chance\uff0cso he determined to continue.\nAt last, he received a letter from the prison officer, which said, \u201cPlease write on the best paper you can afford.

Luo bought some lanterns from a store, but the sales were not as good as he had expected. Then he found another way to do business. He bought lanterns on the Internet at a very low price. Finally he easily made 5,000 yuan in two days.\nWith a happy beginning, Luo planned to open a dress shop. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t support me opening a dress shop, so I had to borrow 120,000 yuan for it.\u201d Although he did market research before starting, the business wasn\u2019t very good because his taste in fashion wasn\u2019t accepted by customers.

But, like any king whose throne has been taken away, the Swiss star is already planning secretly his return to power, beginning at this week\u2019s US Open.\nThe problem is, many experts think he will never do it. They blame everything from age and tough competition to his racket and psychology.\nFor years Federer, 27, had enjoyed the view from the top. Competitors saw him as undefeated, and for the most part he was. However, before the 2008 season began, Federer had an illness that stole his strength and clearly affected his play on the court. Ever since, he has struggled to return to form, winning just two of his last 14 tournaments.\n\u201cTwenty-seven is an age when \n.\u201d tennis great John McEnroe told the New York Times.\nPancho Sefura, another tennis great, noted that Federer is also facing a maturing crop of young talents. \u201cThere are too many great players now,\u201d he said, naming Britain\u2019s Andy Murray, 21, and Latvia\u2019s Ernests Gulbis, 20.\nUS magazine Sports Illustrated tennis columnist Jon Wertheim suggested that part of Federer\u2019s problem could be his insistence on using a small racket. He says that the smaller head demands ball control. But we see time and again that racket makers try to get players to use a certain stick \u2014 one they would like to market to consumers and it has a negative effect the professional game.\nSports psychologist Jim Loehr told the Times that Federer is probably feeling \u201ca sense of doubt\u201d after being considered as undefeated for so long. If Federer is to recover his state of being undefeated, Loehr said he must overcome his doubt. \u201cFederer doesn\u2019t need fame and money. But he has to get better. He has to go to a whole new level. That\u2019s the only way he stays in the game,\u201d he said.\nAs for beginning his first Grand Slam in ages as the NO.2 seed, Federer said it might be for the best. \u201cFive years almost, I was expected to win every tournament I entered,\u201d he said, \u201cso maybe Rafael Nadal now feels what I had to feel for a very long time. It will be interesting to see how he handles it.\u201d\n\u5c0f\u98981:What does the underlined sentence \u201cyour body starts talking back to you\u201d in Para.4 mean?\n\u5c0f\u98982:From the passage, we know the main reason why Federer\u2019s throne was taken away is that _____.\n\u5c0f\u98983:What can be inferred from the passage?\n\u5c0f\u98984:What\u2019s the best title of the passage?\n"},

Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. The beginnings of modem dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed.\nHer search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea. Her great contributions are in three areas.\nFirst, she began the expansion of the kinds of movements that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concerts.\u00a0 In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity (\u6280\u5de7\u9ad8\u8d85) shown by complicated, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using all her body in the freest possible way.\u00a0 Her dance stemmed from (\u6e90\u81ea) her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.\nHer second contribution lies in dance costumes (\u670d\u88c5). She discarded corset, ballet shoes, and stiff costumes.\u00a0 These were replaced with flowing clothes, bare feet, and unlimited hair.\u00a0 She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.\nHer third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies (\u4ea4\u54cd\u4e50) of great masters, including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom.\nShe was as exciting and eccentric in her personal life as in her dance.\n\u5c0f\u98981:. The best title for the passage would be\u201c_________\u201d.\n\u5c0f\u98982: According to the passage, nature meant_________ to Duncan.\n\u5c0f\u98983: The paragraph following the passage most probably discusses_________.\n"},

Thomas Jefferson is not happy. He'd rather be home in Virginia than attending \nPhiladelphia's Continental Congress(\u5927\u9646\u4f1a\u8bae) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thomas Jefferson knew he had a job to do. Important men throughout the American colonies (\u6b96\u6c11\u5730)\nwere meeting in Philadelphis to discuss and debate the war with Great Briain. The colony of Virginia sent\n Thomas Jefferson to Philadelphia. But Jefferson wasn't happy. Jefferson wanted to be home that hot summer\n of 1776. he missed his wife, Martha. She hadn't been feeling well when he left, and he worried about her. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee from Virginia stood up at the Congress and announced that \"these \nAmerican colonies ought to be free and independent states.\" Jefferson probably knew what was coming next.\n Here was another resolution (\u51b3\u8bae)to debate. And whenever there was a resolution, there was a declaration. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The American colonies had been at war with Great Britain for more than a year, but surprisingly. The \ncolonies had not formally announced their independence. So the Congress appointed a five-man committee to \ncrate a document declaring America's independence. And the committee chose Thomas Jefferson to write it. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jefferson knew he was to list the unfair things Great Britain had done to the colonies. For days and days,\n Jefferson wrote and rewrote about the king and his unfair laws. About independence. About freedom. He \nborrowed ideas from other political writers, but he wrote these thoughts in words that all people could \nunderstand. He wanted his ideas to be shared with everyone. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And \n were. The Continental Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.\n on July 8, it was read out loud to a cheering crowd. No one knew who the author was, but they knew what\n the Declaration stood for-independence and freedom for all. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Still, Thomas Jefferson dreamed of home. In late July he begged Richard Henry Lee to replace him in the\n Congress. In September, Jefferson's dream finally came true, and he traveled home.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Since then, the words Thomas Jefferson wrote during that hot Philadelphia summer have inspired people\n throughout the world.

As for me, I learned both before twelve \nbecause of living close to Lake Ontario.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The last time Dad and I set sail together was really unforgettable. It was a perfect weekend after I \ngraduated from university. I came home and invited Dad to go sailing. Out we set soon on the calm lake. \nDad hadn't\u00a0\n\u00a0for years, but everything\u00a0\n\u00a0well with the tiller(\u8235\u67c4)in his hands.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When we were in the middle of the lake, a\u00a0\n\u00a0wind came all of a sudden. The boat was hit violently. Dad was always at his best in any danger,\u00a0\n\u00a0at this moment he froze.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"John!\u00a0\n!\" he shouted in a trembling voice, with the tiller still in his hands.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In my memory he could fix any\u00a0\n. He was the one I always\u00a0\n\u00a0to for strength and security. \nBefore I could respond, a wave of water got into the boat. I rushed to the tiller but it was too late. Another huge wall of water turned\u00a0\n\u00a0the boat in a minute. We were thrown into the water, and Dad was \nstruggling aimlessly. At that moment, I felt fiercely protective of him. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I swam to Dad quickly and assisted him in climbing onto the hull(\u8239\u58f3)of the boat. Upon sitting on the hull, Dad was a little awkward about his flash of.\u00a0\n\u00a0\"It's all right, Dad. We are safe now,\" I comforted him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That was the first time Dad had counted on me in a moment of emergency. More importantly, I found it was my turn to start looking out for my father.\n"},

I said that \nwe must very often give things up as we grow-our youth, our beauty, our friends-but it always \n that \nafter we give something up, we gain something new in its place. Then suddenly my father \n up. He said, \"But, Peter. I gave up \n! What did I gain?\" I thought and thought, but I could not think of anything to \nsay.\n, he answere\nd his own question. \"I \n the love of my family.\" I looked at my sisters, and saw\n tears in their eyes, along with hope and thankfulness.

They ran at him, knocking all his books out \nof his arms and he fell down in the dirt. His glasses went\u00a0\n and landed in the grass about ten feet away\nfrom him. My\u00a0\n went out to him. So, I ran over to him. As I handed him his glasses, he looked at me \nand said, \"Hey, thanks!\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As it turned out, he lived near me. We\ntalked all the way home. He turned out to be a pretty\u00a0\n kid. Over the next four years, Kyle and I \nbecame best friends\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kyle was the top student of our class, one of those guys that really found themselves during high \nschool. He had to prepare a speech for\u00a0\n. On the graduation day, I could see that he was\u00a0\n about \nhis speech. So, I patted him on the back and said, \"Hey, big guy, you'll be great!\" He looked at me and\nsmiled. At graduation, he cleared his throat, and began. \"Graduation is a time to\n those who helped \nyou make it through those\u00a0\n years. Your parents, your teachers, but mostly your friends. I am here to \ntell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give them.

When Jim was a child, his father, a teacher, suffered a heart \nattack and stayed home to recover. One morning Jim asked his father to look over his homework,\n promising to come home from school at noon to pick it up. His father agreed, but when Jim returned \nhis father had died. Jim's father was 48.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I think all his life Jim believed he killed his father,\" Dr. Smoller says. \"He felt that if he had not \nasked him to look at his homework, his father would not have lived.

You\u2019ll need it\u2014\u2014the desert gets rather cold at night. During the day, the temperature will be agreeable and comfortable. Any other time, pack as if you\u2019re going to Phoenix of Vegas in August. For the ladies, bathing suits are normal if there\u2019s a pool where you are going, but leave the string bikini at home \u2013it is a Muslim country, after all. Last, if you are planning on visiting any mosques\uff08\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa\uff09or certain parts of upper Egypt, ladies will need to plan on bringing something that comes at least to the elbow\uff08\u8098\u90e8\uff09, and no shorts for men or women in those areas.\nWhat special things do I need to pack?\nOne of my favorite things in the world to bring to Egypt is an Evian Mister, a sprayer with a fine mist of Evian water. You may be able to find it in your local drug store. Spray a little on your face or head , and your body temperature will feel like it\u2019s dropped 10 or 15 degrees. Other items include your camera, sun block and extra batteries.\nHow do I communicate with home?\nInternet cafes are plentiful everywhere, especially in Cairo, Luxor, and Alexandria. If you have international calling on you phone, you should be able to use it-AT\uff06T and Sprint both work internationally for sure, but make sure you have the international coverage. A satellite phone is best if you are certain to need coverage in the middle of the country, like while sailing up the Nile , but for most people these days a cell phone is fine.\nWhat medical preparation do I need?\nIn a word: none! The one thing you may come down with in Egypt is politely called \u201cPharoah \u2019s Revenge. \u201d The thing that gets rid of pharoah\u2019s Revenge is a regionally produced medicine, and is available at every drugstore for \uff041 a box . DON\u2019T\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 drink local water. DO drink bottled water, avoid the skins of fresh vegetables, and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\u5c0f\u98981: What clothing is proper for ladies visiting a mosque?\n\u5c0f\u98982:What\u2019s the use of an Evian Mister?\n\u5c0f\u98983:What information is provided about distance communication?\n\u5c0f\u98984:What does \u201cPharoah \u2018s Revenge\u201d probably refer to in the last paragraph?\n\u5c0f\u98985:The purpose of this passage is to\n.\n"},

It\u2019s hardly surprising that your feelings of not being \u201cgrown up\u201d have come on strongly at this point in your life, just before you\u2019re about to become a father. You are asking: will I make a good father? How will I deal with? Should I have brought another little person into the world? Can I provide for it? Help! I think nearly every sensitive about-to-be-parent must have these occasional feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy\uff08\u4e0d\u9002\uff09before the birth and it would be most unusual if you didn\u2019t share them.\nIt\u2019s difficult, honestly, to feel grown-up unless you have something less grown-up to relate to. The boss with a hen-pecking wife may feel like a seven-year-old when he\u2019s at home. But as he walks through the office door, and knows he\u2019s going to be surrounded by staff looking to him for advice, he grows into a fully mature\uff08\u6210\u719f\u7684\uff09man. And I think it\u2019s a mistake to imagine that we all feel, as we age, a kind of progression of states, from the baby to the adult. Most people feel, on Tuesday, about three years old, and on a Wednesday, around 80. I remember feeling very grown-up at eight, a time when I was weighed down with responsibility. These days, much older, I can, in the company of people I feel at ease with, feel like a young girl.\nThere\u2019s a common remark that \u201call men are little boys\u201d, but it\u2019s not true. It\u2019s more true that men often behave like little boys. But nearly all people, at some moments in their lives, are able of great maturity.\nOnce your baby arrives, you\u2019ll soon feel less childlike, or rather, less often. When your child tries to put its fingers into the electric plug, the adult in you will rise up to prevent it. You\u2019ll see you have very little in common with a needy child, particularly if it\u2019s looking to you for comfort and support.\nComfort yourself, David, with two truths. One is that your friends laugh when they talk about this subject because they, like you, feel frightened. And remember that people who haven\u2019t grown up don\u2019t go around talking about the fact that they don\u2019t feel grown-up.\nHope my advice will be helpful and good luck to you and your little one.\nSincerely Yours,\nMiss Advice\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to the passage, Miss Advice thinks David\u2019s self-doubt _______.\n\u5c0f\u98982: From Paragraph 2, we can learn that people\u2019s sense of maturity _______.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Miss Advice holds the view that _______.\n"},

Our hope was that by matching young hurricane survivors with a new pen pal, we could help them in their recovery from the trauma (\u521b\u4f24) they experienced.\nThe program is now available to all children worldwide. We continue to welcome teachers, youth groups or agencies who like to work with hurricane survivors.\nHow does it work?\nAmazing Kids! will match students of the same gender and age with other students who may share similar interests and hobbies, based on the information provided on the registration form.\nI\u2019ve completed all forms and made my payment.

If the match is determined not to be a good one, Amazing Kids! will try and find an alternative match.\n\u5c0f\u98981:.If a group of twenty children want to join the program, they should pay _____altogether.\n\u5c0f\u98982:.Parents may agree the program helps children_________.\n\u5c0f\u98983: In the beginning the Amazing Kids!

It warns of a \"crisis\" with more than six million people so disillusioned they have given up looking for work.

It wants more training schemes, and also tax breaks for employers. \n\"The youth unemployment crisis can be beaten but only if job creation for young people becomes a key priority in policymaking and private sector investment picks up significantly,\" said Jose Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs, executive director of the ILO's employment sector.\nSince 2007, the number of young people without jobs has risen by four million - up from less than 12%, the Global Employment Trends for Youth Report says. Almost 13% of people aged between 15 and 24 - or almost 75 million - have no work, although this is slightly down on its peak in 2009.\nIn the European Union, one in five young people are looking for work, the report claims. Some 27.9% of youths were unemployed in North Africa last year \u2014a rise of five percentage points on 2010. In the Middle East, the figure stood at 26.5% in the report's regional breakdown. Even in East Asia, perhaps the most economically active region, the unemployment rate was 2.8 times higher for young people than for adults, the report said.\nBut, the ILO report reveals, the true picture of youth unemployment is even more pessimistic. Many young people are extending their time in higher education because they cannot find jobs. Others are taking part-time unskilled work because they cannot find work in the fields they trained for. \nThe ILO says that more than six million young people worldwide have given up looking for work and are becomingly increasingly detached from society. By not using their skills they are losing them, the report says, and if there is no improvement in the jobs market soon, they may be not only unemployed, but unemployable.\nThe ILO suggests offering tax breaks to businesses hiring young people and offering more programmes to help kick-start careers.\n\u5c0f\u98981:Which of the following is true according to Jose Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs?\n\u5c0f\u98982:The various figures in paragraph 3 and 4 were used to show_______.\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to ILO, the following are caused by high youth unemployment rate except_______.\n\u5c0f\u98984:The ILO offered many solutions to the crisis of youth unemployment, including_______.\na. making job creations a priority \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b. more training schemes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nc. encouraging public investment\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 d. tax breaks for employers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\ne. offering more entrepreneurship programmes to help start careers\n"},

Two years ago, Shanghai topped the 2012 international PISA tables for maths, while England was ranked in 26th place. The top five were all in Southeast Asia, with 15-year-olds in Shanghai judged to be three years ahead of their peers in maths.\nThe education department said: \"England's performance in maths has lagged behind while other countries have improved and overtaken us, including Poland and Germany.\" Actually, it is the latest step in the government's drive to raise standards in maths, looking at what has made schools in the far East the most successful in the world in teaching the subject.\n\"Shanghai is the top-performing part of the world for maths\u2014their children are streets ahead.

As a matter of fact, foreign festivals are becoming more popular than certain traditional Chinese festivals among the Chinese people, particularly the youth. \u201cCertain traditional festivals have died out because people have forgotten their spiritual meanings,\u201d said noted writer Feng Jicai. More and more Chinese people are beginning to exchange gifts on Valentine\u2019s Day and Christmas.

Compared with foreign festivals, traditional Chinese festivals are not inferior(\u6b21\u4e8e) in cultural meanings, but lack of fashion sought by modern people. If people do not appreciate the historical culture contained by traditional festivals, and only take pleasure-seeking as the most important, the significance of traditional festivals will fade away and the inheritance(\u7ee7\u627f) of fine traditional culture will be cut off. \n\u5c0f\u98981:The second paragraph implies that______________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:We can learn from the passage that _________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Many Chinese youth dislike traditional festivals because they think _________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:What would be the best title of the passage?\n"},

It has taken over our culture --- and our smartphones. The rise of the selfie has become universal\u2013between presidents, celebrities(\u540d\u4eba) and citizens alike\u2013and the trend is only continuing to grow. \nA recent survey conducted by the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that 54 percent of Internet users have posted original photos online. And of those hundreds of millions of photos, many are of selfie photos.\nFor example, currently there are nearly 62 million posted selfie photos on Instagram, the social media tool that has significantly contributed to the personal photo\u2019s popularity. That figure, which continues to rise every day, doesn\u2019t even begin to include the selfies shared on Facebook and Twitter.\nWhat makes the selfie so attractive -- and why do we feel it a must to take one? According to Dr. Pamela Rutledge, psychologist and director of the Media Psychology Research Center, the desire to take, post and get \u201clikes\u201d on selfies goes back to a biological behavior of all humans.\n\u201cI think it influences our sense of social connection in the same way as it does when you go to a party and people say \u2018Oh I love your dress,\u2019\u201d Rutledge told The Huffington Post. \u201cBiological, social recognition is a real need and there is even an area of the brain that contributes to social activity.\u201d\nThere is a way to adapt to the growing selfie culture. Whether you\u2019re a selfie \n or an advanced poster, there are always things to be mindful of when you\u2019re posting, Rutledge advises. \nShe offered two main principles to follow when it comes to posting on social media:\n1. The Grandmother Rule\n\u201cDon\u2019t post anything online, whether text or visual, that you don\u2019t want grandmother or future employer to see,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cSelfies especially.\u201d\n2. The Elevator Rule \n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t say something in an elevator that you or no one else wants to hear -- the whole world of social media is an elevator,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cBe aware of the breadth (\u5bbd\u5ea6) of platform. It\u2019s easy to think you\u2019re sharing a photo with a few people, but Instagram is public and people can come across things.\u201d\n\u5c0f\u98981:What\u2019s the main idea of the first paragraph?\n\u5c0f\u98982: According to the passage, people like \u201cselfie\u201d so much, because they ___________.\n\u5c0f\u98983: The underlined word \u201cnovice\u201d in Paragraph 6 probably means \u201c________\u201d.\n\u5c0f\u98984:When it comes to posting on social media, Rutledge advises people to ______.\n"},

People scrambled (\u4e89\u5148\u6050\u540e) for souvenir pieces-keys, hammers, strings and splinters. The tradition began in 1972 at the Baker House dormitory and has been observed irregularly until 2006 when it became an annual event.\nWhile most of us will love to go on a vacation for a week or two on a small private sailboat, without doubt, spending seven precious years on sea is something most of us will never imagine or dare to do.

Now, their mistake has been worsened after further research found it was even older \u2013 at 507 years.\nThe ocean quahog, a type of deep-sea clam, was dredged (\u6355\u635e) alive from the bottom of the North Atlantic near Iceland in 2006 by researchers. They then put it in a fridge-freezer, as is normal practice, unaware of its age. It was only when it was taken to a laboratory that scientists from Bangor University studied it and concluded it was 400 years old.\nThe discovery made it into the Guinness Book of World Records. However, by this time, it was too late for Ming the Mollusc(\u8f6f\u4f53\u52a8\u7269), named after the Chinese dynasty when its life began. Unfortunately researchers who calculated Ming\u2019s age killed it instantly by opening its shell.\nThe researchers opened the ancient clam up to judge its age by counting growth rings inside. But the rings were so close together that scientists ended up having to count the rings on the outside to be accurate, leading CBS journalists to point out that if scientists had just started there, Ming could have lived on. Now, after examining the quahog more closely, using more advanced methods, the researchers have found the animal was actually 100 years older than they first thought.\n Dr Paul Butler, from the University\u2019s School of Ocean Sciences, said: \u201cWe got it wrong the first time and maybe we were a bit hasty publishing our findings back then.

Utoya Island was a youth camp run by Norway's Labor Party. One day in July, a heavily armed, right-wing extremist stepped onto the island and began shooting at random. Sixty-nine people died, over 100 were wounded; almost all, young people. This month, artist Jonas Dahlberg was appointed to create a memorial. He described to us the experience he imagines for those who come to the island.\nDAHLBERG: You start your walk through a forest of evergreens on a wooden pathway. After a while, this pathway starts to go down into the landscape.\nMONTAGNE: Down into the landscape, and into a short tunnel. When you come out, you are unable to go any farther. You can't get to the tip of the island because it has been cut off. So all you can do is look across a narrow channel of water at what is now a wall of polished stone, carved with the names of the dead.\nDAHLBERG: It becomes almost like a gravestone. You cannot reach it. It's close enough to be able to read, but it's forever lost for your possibility to reach.\nMONTAGNE: It's being called \n. Exactly what do you mean by that?\nDAHLBERG: During my first site visit, the experience of seeing those gunshots\u2014and you can see it was like being in an open wound. And it took me to a stage of deep sadness where it was hard to breathe. So I didn't want to illustrate loss; I wanted to make actual loss. It's just a cut through the island.\nMONTAGNE: On the day of the massacre, just hours before launching his shooting on the island, the killer set off a bomb in downtown Oslo, leaving eight people dead. As those events were unfolding, artist Jonas Dahlberg had been out with his brother, and stopped in at a seaside village.\nDAHLBERG: In the harbor, it was silent, and this is the higher end of summer. So, it's normally a very lively place. And it was total silence there; and it was a very, very strange feeling in the whole small village. And it's totally impossible to grasp what is going on. And then it just kept on. It's still almost impossible to understand it. It's also one of the reasons why it's so important with memorials for these kind of things. It's to maybe help a little bit to understand what was happening. So it's not just about remembering. It's also about trying to just understand.\nMONTAGNE: Artist Jonas Dahlberg designed the memorial for the 69 who died at a youth camp on Utoya Island. The attack was the deadliest in Norway since World War II. That memorial will open in 2015. And to see a virtual version of what it will look like, go to our website, at npr.org.

Five years after bankruptcy(\u7834\u4ea7), its profits were beyond expectations and its share price was rising. But the new boss's to-do list was long: fixing GM's loss-making European arm, keeping up momentum(\u52bf\u5934) in China amid signs of a slowdown and giving new life to the product line. The former CEO, Dan Akerson, warned her that she would also face unexpected challenges. The first has arrived sooner than she might have expected.\nWhat appeared to be a routine recall(\u53ec\u56de) of about 800,000 older models, linked to a faulty ignition(\u70b9\u706b) switch, has turned out to be anything but. The number of cars recalled has leapt to more than 2.6 million. The company's clumsy handling of a safety problem that first became apparent a decade ago is now linked to the deaths of at least 13 motorists.\nCalled before Congress to answer for GM's failings Ms Barra said she was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d but insisted that the post-bankruptcy \u201cnew GM\u201d was not like the \u201cold GM\u201d, which had failed to deal with the ignition switches for years. Politicians and the public alike want to know how such a problem could have remained unaddressed for so long.\nCars are becoming ever more complex machines, with thousands of mechanical and electronic parts. Last year it happened to 22 million vehicles in America, compared with 18 million in 2012. In fact, GM was one of only three brands that recalled fewer vehicles than it sold. Minor problems, like squeaks(\u5431\u5431\u54cd) or rattles(\u5361\u55d2\u54cd), that do not affect safety are more common still. They may be fixed at a routine service; the owner may never know. The growing number of recalls is proof to an improving system for picking up faults. \nBut it is very complicated. Dealers must record replacements of parts under warranty(\u4fdd\u4fee). The carmaker needs to spot the trend, recognize it as a problem and then determine whether or not it is a design fault that requires an extensive replacement. It relies on accurate recording of every warranty replacement in every region. This system appears to have broken down at \u201cold GM\u201d. Ms Barra needs to find out why.\nThe core problem is a widely used ignition switch that has a tendency to slip from the \u201con\u201d position to \u201coff\u201d if a driver uses a heavy key-chain or bounces down a rough road. An improvement was made in 2008 to prevent the problem, which can lead to the engine shutting off, disabling the airbags. But despite a growing list of crashes and deaths, GM failed to order a recall for a component that would have cost a few dollars at most.\nThis is odd. Most carmakers want to identify and fix problems speedily despite having to bear the cost of buying and fitting a new component. A small part can do great harm, if bad publicity leads to reputational collapse, lost sales and law suits, including heavy penalties. Appearing to put profits before safety is an invitation to \n a firm's shares, as GM has discovered.\nSo far Ms Barra has handled the situation well. She seems to have acted as soon as she found out something was wrong. GM has appointed a worldwide safety president to cut through the process that may have delayed investigation and action. And in a sweeping housecleaning, GM has recalled another 2 million vehicles in America alone. GM looks set to accept moral, if not legal, responsibility. The terms of its exit from bankruptcy give immunity to lawsuits for injuries arising beforehand. But GM is likely to compensate survivors\u2019 and victims' families anyway.\nIt is not yet clear how much of a hammering GM will take. But hours before Ms Barra's meeting with Congress, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety issued a greatly desired \u201cTop Safety Pick\u201d for the new Chevrolet Malibu, one of a growing number of well-received cars from GM. \n\u5c0f\u98981:When Mary Barra took office, there was plenty more room for GM's improvement in that ________.\na. the development of Chinese market appears to be slowing down\nb. former bosses have failed to fix GM's loss-making European arm\nc. some car models lack appeal in the market\nd.

Referring to the \u201ctransformative\u201d experience he and others undertook in the four-plus years spent making \u201cGravity\u201d, Cuaron, whose hair is graying, said, \u201cFor a lot of these people, that transformation was wisdom.

His co-star, Jared Leto, won best supporting actor for his role as Woodroof\u2019s unlikely business partner, the transgender woman Rayon, for which he also slimmed down drastically.\nAustralia\u2019s Cate Blanchett won the best actress Oscar for her acclaimed role as the socialite unhinged by her husband\u2019s financial crimes in Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cBlue Jasmine.\u201d \u201cAs random and subjective as this award is, it means a great deal in a year of, yet again, extraordinary performances by women,\u201d said Blanchett, who beat out previous Oscar winners Bullock, Amy Adams, Judi Dench and Meryl Streep.\n\u5c0f\u98981:The film which won the largest number of Oscar awards this year is ______.\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which director spent the least money in making the film?\n\u5c0f\u98983:How many Oscar best actresses are mentioned in this passage?\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following statements is WRONG?\n"},

The measure passed by the convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word flashed on the Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess, executive director of the Right to Die Society of Canada. He sent it on by way of the group\u2019s online service, Death NET. Says Hofsess: \u201cWe posted bulletins all day long, because of course this isn\u2019t just something that happened in Australia. It\u2019s world history.\u201d\nThe full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of the Terminally Ill Law has left physicians and citizens alike trying to deal with its moral and practical implications. Some have breathed sighs of relief, others, including churches, right-to-life groups and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the hurry of its passage. \n In Australia\u2014where an aging population, life-extending technology and changing community attitudes have all played their part\u2014other states are going to consider making a similar law to deal with euthanasia (\u5b89\u4e50\u6b7b).

After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson, a 54-year-old Darwin resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally Ill Law means he can get on with living without the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what I was afraid of was how I\u2019d go, because I\u2019ve watched people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks,\u201d he says.\n\u5c0f\u98981: Which of the following has the similar meaning to \u201c\n\u201d?\n\u5c0f\u98982: From the second paragraph we learn that __________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:By saying \u201c\n\u201d, the author means __________.\n\u5c0f\u98984: We can learn from the passage that Lloyd Nickson __________.\n\u5c0f\u98985: The author\u2019s attitude towards euthanasia seems to be that of __________.\n"},

Now a research by Cornell University suggests how life style and decisions about eating may affect weight. Researchers concluded that the French tend to stop eating when they feel full. However, Americans tend to stop when their plate is empty or their favorite TV show is over.\n According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, a health expert, the French see eating as an important part of their life style. They enjoy food and therefore spend a fairly long time at the table, while Americans see eating as something to be squeezed between the other daily activities. Mercola believes Americans lose the ability to sense when they are actually full. So they keep eating long after the French would have stopped. In addition, he points out that Americans drive to huge supermarkets to buy canned and frozen foods for the week. The French, instead, tend to shop daily, walking to small shops and farmers\u2019 markets where they have a choice of fresh fruits, vegetables, and eggs as well as high-quality meats for each meal.\n After a visit to the United States, Mireille Guiliano, author of French Women Don\u2019t Get Fat, decided to write about the importance of knowing when to stop rather than suggesting how to avoid food. Today she continues to stay slim and rarely goes to the gym.\n In spite of all these differences, evidence shows that recent life style changes may be affecting French eating habits. Today the rate of obesity \u2014 or\u00a0 extreme overweight \u2014 among adults is only 6%. However, as American fast food gains acceptance and the young reject older traditions, the obesity rate among French children has reached 17% \u2014 and is growing.\n\u5c0f\u98981:In what way are the French different from Americans according to Dr. Joseph Mercola?\n\u5c0f\u98982:This text is mainly the relationship between _________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:The text is mainly developed __________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:Where does this text probably come from?\n"},

Notably, there were many Japanese reporters present, hoping to break the news that Haruki Murakami had won the prize. Finally, the Swedish Academy's Permanent Secretary Peter Englund stepped out from the doors and said Canadian short story writer Alice Munro has won the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature.\nThe following is a truncated Q&A with reporters and Englund. (The questions have been simplified and clarified.)\nWhy did Alice Munro win?\nWe gave her the Nobel Prize in Literature because she is a master of the contemporary short story.\nWhich book to begin with?\nOne of the amazing things about her is that she has no weak works in her writing. She has always worked to the best of her ability; she has always cultivated the short story to perfection. And she has never really written a weak or bad book. So you can take your pick. 'The Moons of Jupiter' was the first book I read by her and you can see both her different themes in that book and also her very special narrative mode, you can find it there. She tells her stories a bit like nobody else. She has a very economical language and sparse style. You can find that in 'The Moons of Jupiter.' You can take your pick. The latest one is obviously very interesting, 'Dear Life,' which contains a number of autobiographical sketches at the end that gives a key to the entire authorship of Alice Munro.\nHow was she informed?\nWell, I left a message on her answering machine. I couldn't reach her and it was of course pretty early in the morning. But she will be notified by courier, by email to her both agents, by standard mail and so on.\nWhat kind of message did you leave?\nBasically, congratulations! You've won the Nobel Prize in literature.\nWhat's the Importance of a woman winning?\nDon't ask me. We picked her for excellence, nothing else. Of course it matters when you start doing the headcount. But she is no representative. She has received this prize just because of what she has done. Nothing else.\nSo the sexual balance doesn't count?\nWe don't have these kinds of quotas; thank god ... We don't have any quotas. We could, if we wanted to, award this prize four times in a row to a children's book writer working in the United States. If we wanted to. We can do as we please. We don't have to fill any quotes in any direction. We just give it to authors who show an extraordinary literary quality. One of these is Mrs. Alice Munro.\n\u5c0f\u98981:Why were there so many Japanese reporters in the Stock Exchange Building in Stockholm's Old Town?\n\u5c0f\u98982:Alice Munro would most probably be informed of her winning by ________?\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, Alice Munro was awarded the 2013 Noble Prize in Literature mainly for ________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:Alice Munro is best known for her work ________.\n"},

The earth plates travel in different directions and at different speeds. If one plate is slowly forced underneath the other,\u00a0 pressure builds up until the plates break apart. This process causes the ground to move. It is an earthquake. In other words, earth-quakes are the shaking of the earth\u2019s surface caused by the earth\u2019s rocky outer layer as a result of the energy stored within the earth. The strain within the rocks is suddenly released (\u91ca\u653e). \n The damage an earthquake causes depends on where it is and the time it is happening. If an unpopulated region is struck, there will be low loss of life or property. If it hits a large city, there may be many in-juries and much destruction. Many of the areas at risk are largely populated now. Major earthquakes hitting those areas today could produce terrible damage. \n Actually, there are several million small earth-quakes every year.\u00a0 Large earthquakes such as the 1964 Alaskan quake that measured 9.2 on the Richter scale, cause millions of dollars in damage. In the last 500 years, millions of people have been killed by earth-quakes around the world \u2014 including 240,000 in the 1976 Tangshan earthquake in China.\n A 60-second or less earthquake can cause devastation that continues for years after the first tremor (\u5c0f\u9707).

Fifteen years later, the city still looked the way it had a week after the earthquake hit, because the country did not have the necessary money to rebuild it.\n The shaking of the earth is sometimes not the greatest disaster. It is in the ensuing fires and floods that often the greatest damage occurs. In the 1906 earthquake, it was the fires caused after it that did the majority of the damage.

Babies are \nbasically equipped to hear and distinguish every possible language and dialect, but once they reach 6 months\n old, they begin to focus on the particular sounds that exist in the languages that they're exposed to. In this \nway, kids will naturally and automatically be bilingual (\u53cc\u8bed\u7684) if they hear multiple languages on a daily \nbasis when they are still babies.. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One lady told me of her son who grew up in a very multi-cultural community working at a resort. He \nwould naturally and easily switch from Dutch, to French, to Italian, German and English depending on who \nhe was talking to. Of course that's an extreme case, but it's completely possible and easy. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It' s not true that they will get mixed up by learning multiple languages. They may mix them up purposely\n simply because certain words or expressions are easier, but they won't develop any permanent language \ndisabilities. Quite the contrary, bilingual children have been shown to be as much as a year more advanced in\n learning ability development for 2 and 3 years olds. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some kids who simply aren't gifted at learning languages, just as some aren't gifted at sports or music, \nwill find it difficult to continue schooling in a foreign language. In that case, it may be better not to continue \nwith the foreign language school. Still, it will have been an excellent opportunity for Grade One. Perhaps for \nGrade Two you could try a bilingual school. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any case, learning even a small amount of a foreign language, maintaining the ability to hear and\n pronounce it by listening to music and movies will keep a foundation for later learning.

A new iPhone application (\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f) MealSnap may help. Users just need to take a picture of the meal with the phone, and it will give a calorie read-out almost immediately.\nMealSnap was developed by DailyBurn, a health social network that focuses on helping its users lead healthier lifestyles. It has created several other health and diet-related iPhone applications. The application gives users a quick reply. To do that, it matches the taken picture to a databank (\u6570\u636e\u5e93) with the calorie information of nearly 500,000 kinds of food. Users then get the range of calories for the meal that is photographed.\nWe started with something simple\u2014an apple. A couple of minutes later, the application replied that it was an apple and between 64 and 96 calories. More impressive was the reply we received after sending a photo of a mixed salad bowl. MealSnap replied that the bowl contained \u201cyellow rice with corn, boiled eggs and beans\u201d and that the food was between 532 and 789 calories.\nMr. Smith, director of DailyBurn, said that usual calorie counting needed a long time, but that the application made it easier to know the calories in food. That is why it is so popular among those who are trying hard to lose weight.\nIn addition, MealSnap can act as a food diary. No need to write down what they\u2019ve eaten, the photoes will be stored. The users can keep a visual log (\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55). Mr. Smith said, \u201cit\u2019s like a food journey, but easier. All you do is to take the picture. The simple act of recording something can cause a psychological (\u5fc3\u7406\u7684) change that can help people on their health journey.

Judging from the experiment of Frederick in the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.\nAll the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.\nToday no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If there sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.\nExperts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months they can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to five words. At three he knows about 1,000 words, which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.\nRecent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man\u2019s brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern \u201ctoy bear\u201d. And even more incredible is the young brain\u2019s ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.\nBut speech has to be induced\uff08\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u5f15\u8d77\uff09, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the children\u2019s babbling\uff08\u54bf\u5440\u58f0\uff09,grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child\u2019s nonverbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language.\n\u5c0f\u98981:The writer mentioned the experiment of Frederick to __________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:The purpose of Frederick\u2019s experiment was to __________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:The reason why some children are backward in speaking is most probably that ________.\n\u5c0f\u98984: If a child starts to speak later than others, he will __________ in future.\n\u5c0f\u98985: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?\n\u5c0f\u98986: According to the passage, the writer agrees that__________.\n"},

These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two.\nWe spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype \uff08\u7f51\u7edc\u7535\u8bdd\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff09. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. BARRY BROWN: \u201cAnd they just\u00a0plugged\u00a0in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn\u2019t until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\u201d\nMr Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. BARRY BROWN: \u201cOne problem with a lot of the GPS units is that they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn. Because they just give you the next turn, sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the\u00a0overview\u00a0that you would need to know that it\u2019s going to the wrong place.\u201d\nBarry Brown formerly served as a professor with the University of California, San Diego. While there, he worked on a project with Eric Laurier from the University of Edinburgh. The two men studied the effects of GPS devices on driving by placing cameras in people\u2019s cars. They wrote a paper based on their research. It is called \u201cThe Normal, Natural Troubles of Driving with GPS.\u201d\nIt lists several areas where GPS systems can cause confusion for drivers. These include maps that are outdated, incorrect or difficult to understand. They also include timing issues(\u65f6\u673a\u95ee\u9898) related to when GPS commands are given.\nBarry Brown says, \u201c To make GPS systems better we need a better understanding of how drivers, passengers and GPS systems work together.\u201d\n\u5c0f\u98981:In paragraph 2, Mr. Brown mentioned his friend in the conversation to _______.\n\u5c0f\u98982:What is the disadvantage of small screens in GPS equipment according to the text?\n\u5c0f\u98983: Which of the following statements would Barry Brown most likely agree with?\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is Mr. Brown\u2019s attitude towards GPS?\n\u5c0f\u98985:Which of the following statements can best describe the main idea of the pasage?\n"},

As long as people eat enough milk, eggs and meat alternates(\u66ff\u4ee3\u7269), they can get enough protein.\n2.

It\nis a legal requirement that all kids be educated, though. When parents believe they can give their kids a better education--- or have other reasons for not wanting to send their kids to a local school --- they may choose home schooling.\nHowever, if a kid hates school, home schooling is probably not the escape he is looking for. Home schooled students can learn just as much as they would in regular school if they and their parents work hard to cover all the subjects and experiences necessary. Parents who home school usually have higher levels of education than parents who do not. They already have the skills to educate themselves about teaching their kids.\nParents who home school have to be able to put the time and skill into not just teaching, but also researching lesson plans and resources(\u8d44\u6e90). So they have to know how to find the information necessary to teach their kids. State schools often provide home-schooling parents with a curriculum(\u8bfe\u7a0b), books and materials and places to meet.

They are more of a clear, yellowish colour. Although blood looks red when it\u2019s outside the body, when it\u2019s sitting in a vein near the surface of the skin, it\u2019s more of a dark reddish purple colour. At the right depth, these blood-filled veins reflect less red light than the surrounding skin, making them look blue by comparison.\nWhich works harder, your heart or your brain?\nThat kind of depends on whether you\u2019re busy thinking or busy exercising. Your heart works up to three times harder during exercise, and shifts enough blood over a lifetime to fill a supertanker. But, in the long run, your brain probably tips it, because even when you\u2019re sitting still your brain is using twice as much as your heart, and it takes four to five times as much blood to feed it.\nWhy do teeth fall out, and why don\u2019t they grow back in grown-up?\nBaby (or \u201cmilk\u201d) teeth do not last long; they fall out to make room for bigger, stronger adult teeth later on. Adult teeth fall out when they become damaged, decayed and infected by bacteria. Once this second set of teeth has grown in, you\u2019re done. When they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone. This is because nature figures you\u2019re set for life, and what controls regrowth of your teeth switches off.\nDo old people shrink as they age?\nYes and no. Many people do get shorter as they age. But, when they do, it isn\u2019t because they\u2019re shrinking all over. They simply lose height as their spine(\u810a\u67f1)becomes shorter and more curved due to disuse and the effects of gravity\uff08\u91cd\u529b\uff09. Many (but not all) men and women do lose height as they get older. Men lose an average of 3\u20144 cm in height as they age, while women may lose 5 cm or more. If you live to be 200 years old, would you keep shrinking till you were, like 60 cm tall, like a little boy again? No, because old people don\u2019t really shrink! It is not that they are growing backwards\u2014their legs, arms and backbones getting shorter. When they do get shorter, it\u2019s because the spine has shortened a little. Or, more often, become more bent and curved.\nWhy does spinning make you dizzy(\u7729\u6655\u7684)?\nBecause your brain gets confused between what you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re feeling. The brain senses that you\u2019re spinning using special gravity-and-motion-sensing organs in your inner ear, which work together with your eyes to keep your vision and balance stable. But, when you suddenly stop spinning the system goes out control, and your brain thinks you\u2019re moving while you\u2019re not!\nWhere do feelings and emotions come from?\nMostly from an ancient part of the brain called the limbic system. All mammals have this brain area\u2014from mice to dogs, cats, and humans. So all mammals feel basic emotions like fear, pain and pleasure. But since human feelings also involve other, newer bits of the brain, we feel more complex emotions than any other animals on the planet.\nIf exercise wears you out, how can it be good for you?\nBecause our bodies adapt to everything we do to them. And as far as your body is concerned, it\u2019s \u201cuse it, or lose it\u201d! It\u2019s not that exercise makes you healthy; it\u2019s more that a lack of exercise leaves your body weak and easily affected by disease.\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the colour of blood in a vein near the surface of the skin?\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why do some old people look a little shrunken as they age?\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following statements about our brain is true?\n\u5c0f\u98984:.

It\u2019s reported that it lives in the shadows(\u9634\u6697\u5904) of Mt. Saint Helens. It has purple skin, red eyes and the character is quite similar to the bat\u2019s. Since reports tell it likes eating small animals like chickens, goats and pigs, some believe that it is actually a flying primate(\u7075\u957f\u76ee\u52a8\u7269). But researchers say that it is more closely related to the fruit bat of northern America.\nFear still fills the hearts of men, women and children of Washington. In May of 1980 during the eruption of Mount Saint Helens, the Batsquatch showed itself in the shadows of clouds from the eruption. In 1994, a local mountaineer was able to take pictures of the Batspuatch making the rumor(\u8c23\u8a00) seem real. During this event some farm animals seemed to disappear though luckily no humans were reported missing at the time. The local mountaineer told about his meeting with the Batsquatch. When he suddenly heard a loud deep voice from the shadows, the mountaineer was knocked down. He tried to look for the creature(\u751f\u7269) that had made the sound. He saw a great creature with purple wings in the sky. It looked like it was about 30 feet tall.\nThe mountaineer kept this story a secret in fear of being laughed at by others but when new stories came in about the Batsquatch he shared his story.\nThe reality of the Batsquatch can no longer be ignored. It is only a creature that is trying to live. Respect! This is how we should take news such as this.

Many people think that they have to accept whatever life throws at them. They'll say, \"This is my destiny. I cannot change it.\"\nOf course not! You don't have to suffer needlessly. Your life depends on you, not on other factors.\nI know a woman who says she just accepts what life gives her because she has done everything she can to improve it. Guess what her lifestyle is? She wakes up in the morning, goes to work, comes back home, relaxes, chats with people, watches TV, and then goes to sleep. Next day, the same routine cycle follows.\nHuh! Is this what she calls \"doing her best\"? She believes she has tried her best and just accepts it in her heart that this is the life that has been intended for her and that her luck can only change if God wills it. She hasn't realized that we have to do our share of making the effort to live the life of our dreams.\nRemember that you harvest what you sow. You have to get off the sofa, get your eyes off the TV screen, get your hands off the phone (unless it\u2019s helpful to your success), and get your mind and body to work! Don't expect your luck to change, unless you do something about it. If something goes wrong, don't just regard it as a temporary(\u6682\u65f6\u7684) problem; Instead, learn your lesson, make the most of the situation, and do something to solve the problem. It's not enough to think positively; you also have to act positively.\nIf someone's life is in trouble, do you just hope and pray that things will turn out fine? Of course not! You get to do anything you can to save the person. So it is with your own life. It is not enough to hope for the best, but you have to do your best.

This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise\u2014and as a result, we are aging unnecessarily soon.\nProfessor Taiju Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern Japan appeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a relatively early age, and how the process of aging could be slowed down.\nWith a team of colleagues at Tokyo National University, he set about measuring brain volumes of a thousand people of different ages and varying occupations.\nComputer technology enabled the researchers to obtain precise measurements of the volume of the front and side sections of the brain, which relate to intellect (\u667a\u80fd) and emotion, and determine the human character. (The rear section of the brain, which controls functions like eating and breathing, does not contract with age, and one can continue living without intellectual or emotional faculties.)\nContraction of front and side parts\u2014as cells die off\u2014was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not evident in some sixty- and seventy-year-olds.\nMatsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple remedy to the contraction normally associated with age\u2014using the head.\u00a0 The findings show in general terms that contraction of the brain begins sooner in people in the country than in the towns. Those least at risk, says Matsuzawa, are lawyers, followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing routine work in government offices are, however, as likely to have shrinking brains as the farm worker, bus driver and shop assistant. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Matsuzawa\u2019s findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking.

We are dealing with the results of that \n in the greenest way possible, but it would be far better if we did not need to bring so much material home in the first place.\n The total amount of packaging has increased by 12% between 1999 and 2005. It now makes up a third of a typical household's waste in the UK. In many supermarkets nowadays food items are packaged twice with plastic and cardboard.\nToo much packaging is doing serious damage to the environment. The UK, for example, is running out of it for burying this unnecessary waste. If such packaging is burnt, it gives off greenhouse gases which go on to cause the greenhouse effect. Recycling helps, but the process itself uses energy. The solution is not to produce such items in the first place. Food waste is a serious problem, too. Too many supermarkets encourage customers to buy more than they need. However, few of them are coming round to the idea that this cannot continue, encouraging customers to reuse their plastic bags, for example.\nBut this is not just about supermarkets. It is about all of us. We have learned to associate packaging with quality. We have learned to think that something unpackaged is of poor quality. This is especially true of food. But it is also applied to a wide range of consumer products, which often have far more packaging than necessary.\nThere are signs of hope.

You can use it to fly a kite or to sail a boat. Wind is one of our cleanest and richest power sources, as well as one of the oldest. Evidence shows that windmills (\u98ce\u8f66) began to be used in ancient Iran back in the seventh century BC. They were first introduced to Europe during the 1100s, when armies returned from the Middle East with knowledge of using wind power.\nFor many centuries, people used windmills to grind (\u78e8\u788e) wheat into flour or pump water from deep underground. When electricity was discovered in the late 1800s, people living in remote (\u504f\u50fb\u7684) areas began to use them to produce electricity. This allowed them to have electric lights and radio. However, by the 1940s when electricity was available to people in almost all areas of the United States, windmills were rarely used.\nDuring the 1970s, people started becoming concerned about the pollution that is created when coal and gas are burned to produce electricity. People also realized that the supply of coal and gas would not last forever. Then, wind was rediscovered, though it means high costs. Today, there is a global movement to supply more and more of our electricity through the use of wind.\n\u5c0f\u98981:From the text we know that windmills _______.\n\u5c0f\u98982: What was a new use for wind power in the late 19\n century ?\n\u5c0f\u98983:One of the reasons why wind was rediscovered in the 1970s is that ______ .\n\u5c0f\u98984:What would the writer probably discuss in the paragraph that follows ?\n"},

Their values\u2014this can\u2019t be repeated too often\u2014are not necessarily our values. Physical comfort, cleanness and order are not necessarily the most important things. The social services from time to time find themselves faced with a flat with decaying food covered by small worms, and an old person lying alone in bed, taking no notice of the worms. But is it interfering(\u5e72\u6d89) with personal freedom to insist that they go to live with some of their relatives so that they might be taken better care of? Some social workers, the ones who clear up the worms, think we are in danger of carrying this concept of personal freedom to the point where serious risks are being taken with the health and safety of the old.\nIndeed, the old can be easily hurt or harmed. The body is like a car, it needs more mechanical maintenance(\u673a\u68b0\u7ef4\u4fee\uff0c\u4fdd\u517b) as it gets older. You can carry this comparison right through to the provision of spare parts. But never forget that such operations are painful experiences, however good the results will be. And at what point should you stop to treat the old body? Is it morally right to try to push off death by seeking the development of drugs to excite the forgetful old mind and to activate the old body, knowing that it is designed to die?

Buildings would rotate\uff08\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09so they could follow the sun to take maximum advantage of its light and heat. Walls would \u201cgive light\u201d and \u201cchange color with the push of a button.\u201d Food would be replaced by pills. School would be taught by electrical impulse\uff08\u7535\u8109\u51b2\uff09while we sleep. Cars would have radar\uff08\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09. Does this sound like the year 2000? Actually, this article was written in 1958 and the question was, \u201cwhat will life be like in 1978?\nThe future is much too important to simply guess about, the way the high school students did, so experts are regularly asked to predict accuately. By carefully studying the present, skilled businessmen, scientists, and politicians are supposedly able to figure out in advance what will happen. But can they? One expert on Cities wrote: Cities of the future would not be crowded, but would have space for farms and fields. People would travel to work in \u201cairbuses\u201d, large all-weather helicopters carrying up to 200 passengers. When a person left the airbus station he could drive a coin-operated car equipped with radar. The radar equipment of cars would make traffic accidents \u201calmost unheard of\u201d. Does that sound familiar? If the expert had been accurate it would, because he was writing in 1957. His subject was \u201cThe city of 1982\u201d.\nIf the professionals sometimes sound like high school students, it\u2019s probably because future study is still a new field. But economic forecasting, or predicting what the economy will do, has been around for a long time. It should be accuate, and generally it is. But there have been some big mistakes in the field, too. In early 1929, most forecasters saw an excellent future for the stock market. In October of that year, the stock market had its worst losses ever, ruining thousands of investors who had put their faith in financial foreseers.\nOne forecaster knew that predictions about the future would always be subject to significant error. In 1957, H.J. Rand of the Rad corporation was asked about the year 2000, \u201cOnly one thing is certain,\u201d he answered. \u201cChildren born today will have reached the age of 43.\u201d\n\u5c0f\u98981:How many examples does the author offer to describe the future life?\n\u5c0f\u98982:The high school students\u2019 answers to \u201cWhat would life be like in 1978?\u201d sound __________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:In the second paragraph, the writer gives examples to show _________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:From the third paragraph we can learn that _________.\n\u5c0f\u98985:H.J.Rand\u2019s prediction about the year 2000 shows that ________.\n"},

People use clothing to declare their membership in a particular social group; however, the rules for what is acceptable dress for that group may change.

By keeping up with fashions, that is, by changing their clothing style frequently but meanwhile, members of a group both satisfy their desire for \n and obey the rules, thus demonstrating their membership in the group.\nThere are some interesting variations (\u53d8\u79cd) regarding individual status. Some people, particularly in the West, consider themselves of such high status that they do not need to display it with their clothing. For example, many wealthy people in the entertainment industry appear in very casual clothes, such as the worn jeans and work boots of a manual laborer. However, it is likely that a subtle but important signal, such as an expensive wristwatch, will prevail over the message of the casual dress. Such an inverted (\u98a0\u5012\u7684)status display is most likely to occur where the person\u2019s high status is conveyed in ways other than with clothing, such as having a famous face.\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to the author, fashions serve all the following purposes EXCEPT\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why does the author discuss individual status in paragraph 2?\n\u5c0f\u98983:What\u2019s the meaning of the underlined word?\n"},

And this was the case for basketball star Yao Ming, who hosted a television show in Shanghai that raised US$300,000 to help researchers find a cure for SARS. Fundraising, or charity, is an act of goodwill towards others. Charities in the West have more flexible ways. Look at a typical day for Ruth, a wealthy woman in the UK, for example. Ruth wakes up in the morning and collects her post. There\u2019s a letter addressed to her with a picture of a half-dead, beaten horse. It\u2019s from a charity asking Ruth to donate money to save the animals. The door bell rings and there, on Ruth\u2019s doorstep, is an old woman asking for money to help the aged. She turns on the television, hears sad music and sees a picture of a wide-eyed child dying of hunger in Africa with an appeal for money to help the child. Ruth then goes shopping for a dress to wear to that evening\u2019s large party for the rich and famous. The ticket cost her a small fortune, but she doesn\u2019t mind because most of the money is going to a charity that fights AIDS. She feels good about going because she\u2019s helping the sick.

From Boston to Los Angeles it is as far as from France to Central Asia, and from east to west there are five time zones; but everywhere people get up and go to bed at about the same time, eat the same kind of food, buy in the same kind of shops, work and rest at the same times of the day and have the same pattern of holidays. In\nthat matter there is less difference between rich people and ordinary people, or between town and country, than in any single European nation.\nAlthough the United States covers so much land and the land produces far more food than the present population needs, its people are by now almost entirely an urban society. Less than a tenth of the people are engaged in agriculture, and most of the rest live in or around towns, large and small. Here the traditional picture is changing; most Americans do not live in small towns any more.

Oh, wonderful! You are so lucky.\u201d\n Perhaps your family and friends said similar things to you when you left home. But is it true all the time?

In the first stage, the newcomers like their new environment. Then, when the fresh experience dies, they begin to hate the city, the country, the people, and everything else. In the last stage, the newcomers adapt to their surroundings and finally enjoy their life there.\n Culture shock arises from many obvious factors. The weather may be unpleasant. The customs may be different. The public service systems such as the telephone, post office, or transportation may be difficult to work out. Even the simplest things become headaches. Still worse, the language may be difficult.\nWho feels culture shock? Everyone does in this way or that. But culture shock surprises most people. Very often the people having the worst culture shock are those who never had any difficulties in their home countries and were successful in their community. Coming to a new country, these people find they do not have the same established positions. They find themselves without a role, almost without an identity. They have to build a new self\u00adimage.\nCulture shock leads to a feeling of disorientation (\u8ff7\u60d8). This feeling may be homesickness. When homesick, people feel like staying inside all the time. They want to protect themselves from the strange environment, and create and escape inside their room for a sense of security. This escape does solve the problem of culture shock for the short term, but it does nothing to make the person familiar with the culture. Getting to know the new environment and gaining experience are the long term solutions to the problem of culture shock.\n\u5c0f\u98981:When people move to a new country, they ________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:Based on the passage, which of the following results from culture shock?\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, the more successful you are at home, ________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following statements is correct according to the passage?\n"},

It is not easy to explain why one person is intelligent and another is not, or why one is cooperative and another is competitive.\u00a0\nSocial scientists are of course extremely interested in these types of questions. They want to explain why we possess certain characteristics and exhibit certain behavior. There are no clear answers yet, but two distinct schools of thought on the matter have developed. As one might expect, the two approaches are very different from each other, and there is a great deal of debate between \nof each theory. The controversy is often conveniently referred to as \u201cnature and nurture\u201d\uff0e\n Those who support the \u201cnature\u201d side of the conflict believe that our personalities and behavior patterns are largely determined by biological factors. That our environment has little, if anything, to do with our abilities, characteristics and behavior is central to this theory. Taken to an extreme\uff0cthis theory states that our behavior is predetermined to such a great degree that we are almost completely governed by our instincts(\u672c\u80fd)\uff0e\n Proponents of the \u201cnurture\u201d theory, or, as they are often called, behaviorists, claim that our environment is more important than our biologically based instincts in determining how we will act. A behaviorist, B. F. Skinner, sees humans as beings whose behavior is almost completely shaped by their surroundings. The behaviorists' view of the human being is quite mechanistic. They state that, like machines, humans respond to environmental stimuli (\u523a\u6fc0) as the basis of their behavior.\u00a0\nSocially and politically, the consequences of these two theories are far-reaching. In the US\uff0cfor example, blacks often score below whites on standardized intelligence tests. This leads some \u201cnature\u201d proponents to conclude that blacks are genetically lower in status than whites. Behaviorists, on the contrary, say that the differences in scores are due to the fact that blacks are often robbed of many of the educational and other environmental advantages that whites enjoy, and that, as a result, they do not develop the same responses that whites do. \n Neither of these theories can yet fully explain human behavior. In fact, it is quite likely that the key to our behavior lies somewhere between these two extremes and that the controversy will continue for a long time is certain.\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98981:This passage is mainly concerned with ________. \n\u5c0f\u98982:The underlined word \u201cproponents\u201d in Paragraph 2 means ________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:In Paragraph 5, the author mainly writes about ________. \n\u5c0f\u98984:What's the author's purpose in writing the passage? \n"},

He played six Bach pieces for about 45 minutes. During that time, since it was rush hour, 1,100 people went through the station, most of them on their way to work.\nThree minutes went by, and a middle aged man noticed there was musician playing. He slowed his pace, and stopped for a few seconds, and then hurried up to meet his schedule.\nA minute later, the violinist received his first dollar tip: a woman threw the money in the money box without stopping, and continued to walk.\nA few minutes later, someone leaned against the wall to listen to him, but the man looked at his watch and started to walk again. Clearly he was late for work.\nThe one who paid the most attention was a 3-year-old boy. His mother tagged him along, hurried, but the kid stopped to look at the violinist. Finally, the mother pushed hard, and the child continued to walk, turning his head all the time. This action was repeated by several other children. All the parents, without exception, forced them to move on.\nIn the 45 minutes the musician played, only 6 people stopped and stayed for a while. About 20 gave him money, but continued to walk their normal pace. He collected $32. When he finished playing and silence took over, no one noticed it. No one applauded, nor was there any recognition.\nNo one knew this, but the violinist was Joshua Bell, one of the most talented musicians in the world. He had just played one of the most beautiful pieces ever written, on a violin worth $3.5 million dollars.\u00a0\nTwo days before his playing in the subway, Joshua Bell sold out at a theater in Boston where the seats averaged $100.\nThis is a real story. Joshua Bell\u2019s playing in the metro station was organized by the Washington Post as part of a social experiment. \nThe outlines were: in a common environment at an inappropriate hour: Do we enjoy beauty? Do we stop to appreciate it? Do we recognize the talent in an unexpected situation?\n One of the possible conclusions from this experience could be: If we do not have a moment to stop and listen to one of the best musicians in the world playing the best music ever written, how many other things are we missing?\u201d\n\u5c0f\u98981:Few people stopped to listen to Joshua Bell playing because______.\n\u5c0f\u98982:When children stopped to look at the violinist, their parents ______.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Joshua Bell played in the metro station in order to ______.\n\u5c0f\u98984:The purpose of the passage is to _____.\n"},

But counterfeit drugs may contain too much, too little or none of the active ingredients (\u539f\u6599) of the real thing. \nPeople do not get the medicine they need.

The medicine was produced by a local drug company that used a dangerous substitute to save money. \nThe problem of counterfeit medicines is especially serious in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

The young in particular are willing to accept this concept because at heart every child wants to grow into a happy, healthy,\u00a0 contributing adult. In fact It is many young people's ambition to set up programmes or businesses that improve social conditions. An excellent example is an Ashoka project started in 1995 in Dhaka, which handled the rubbish problem facing the city ,helped local farmers and provided an income for poor people there .\nWhen Masqsood and Iftekhar began to study the problem of all the uncollected rubbish that lay in Dhaka\u2019s streets,Attracting tats and disease , they discovered that 80% of it was natural waste .

At first , they were refused ,but once they were able to persuade\n that there was money to be made , the project took off.

Progress indicates a person\u2019s ability to change the way he is living at the moment. Progress must lead a better way of doing things. All these, however, remains true only in so far as people want to accept technology and move forward by finding new and more efficient ways of doing things.\nHowever, at the back of the minds of many people, especially those who missed the \u201cgood old days\u201d, \n. When communication becomes efficient, people are able to contact one another no matter where they are and at whatever time they wish to. The click of a button allows people miles apart to talk or to see each other without even leaving their homes. With the communication \n, such as mobile phones and ipads, people often do not take the effect to visit one another personally. A personal visit carries with it the additional feature of having to be in the person\u2019s presence for as long as the visit lasts. We cannot unnecessarily excuse our selves or turn the other person off.\nWith efficiency also comes mass production. Such is the nature of factories and the success of industrialization today. Factories have improved efficiency. Unskillful tasks are left to machines and products are better made and produced with greater accuracy than any human hand could ever have done. However, with the improvements in efficiency also comes the loss of the personal touch when making these products. For example, many handcrafts(\u624b\u5de5\u827a\u54c1) are now produced in a factory. Although this means that supply is better able to increase demand, now that the supply is quick and efficient, the demand might fall because mass production lowers the quality of the handicraft and it is difficult to find unique designs on each item.\nNevertheless, we must not commit the mistake of analyzing progress only from one point of view. In fact, progress has allowed tradition to keep up. It is only with progress and the invention of new technology that many old products can be brought back to their old state. New technology is required for old products to stay old.\nIt is people\u2019s attitude towards progress that causes the type of influence that technology has on society. Technology is flexible. There is no fixed way of making use of it. Everything depends on people\u2019s attitude. The worst effects of progress will fall on those who are unable to rethink their attitudes and views of society. When we accept progress and adapt it to suit our needs, a new \u201cpast\u201d is created.\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to Paragraph 1, progress can benefit people when they are willing to _______.\n\u5c0f\u98982:The underlined word \u201cgadgets\u201d is closest in meaning to _______.\n\u5c0f\u98983:The author explains \u201cefficiency comes with a price\u201d by _______.\n\u5c0f\u98984:Compared with home-made handicrafts, machine made products _______.\n\u5c0f\u98985:What can be learned about technology from Paragraph 4?\n\u5c0f\u98986:What can be concluded from the last paragraph?\n"},

But does Mother Nature agree? Animals can't talk, but can they lie in other ways? Can they lie with their bodies and behavior? Animal experts may not call it lying, but they do agree that many animals, from birds to chimpanzees, behave dishonestly to fool other animals. Why? Dishonesty often helps them survive. \nMany kinds of birds are very successful at fooling other animals. For example, a bird called the plover sometimes pretends to be hurt in order to protect its young. When a predator\uff08\u730e\u98df\u52a8\u7269\uff09gets close to its nest, the plover leads the predator away from the nest. How? It pretends to have a broken wing. The predator follows the \"hurt\" adult, leaving the baby birds safe in the nest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother kind of bird, the scrub jay, buries its food so it always has something to eat. Scrub jays are also thieves. They watch where others bury their food and steal it. But clever scrub jays seem to know when a thief is watching them. So they go back later, unbury the food, and bury it again somewhere else.\nBirds called cuckoos have found a way to have babies without doing much work. How? They don't make nests. Instead, they get into other birds' nests secretly. Then they lay their eggs and fly away. When the baby birds come out, their adoptive parents feed them. \nChimpanzees, or chimps, can also be sneaky. After a fight, the losing chimp will give its hand to the other. When the winning chimp puts out its hand, too, the chimps are friendly again. But an animal expert once saw a losing chimp take the winner's hand and start fighting again. \nChimps are sneaky in other ways, too. When chimps find food that they love, such as bananas, it is natural for them to cry out. Then other chimps come running. But some clever chimps learn to cry very softly when they find food. That way, other chimps don't hear them,\u00a0 and they don't need to share their food.\nAs children, many of us learn the saying \"You can't fool Mother Nature.\" But maybe you can't trust her, either.\n\u5c0f\u98981:A plover protects its young from a predator by______.\n\u5c0f\u98982:By \"Chimpanzees, or chimps, can also be sneaky\" (paragraph 5), the author means______.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following is true according to the passage?\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following might be the best title of the passage?\n"},

In microcosm(\u5fae\u89c2\u4e16\u754c), my school is proof of just how global. Monkseaton High School is an ordinary state-funded school of 850 students in the unfashionable part of northeastern England. Over the past seven years it has sent 12 students to American universities --- two of them to Harvard. Monkseaton has, in turn, attracted students from other countries, including Germany and Latvia. Monkseaton now almost routinely receives inquiries from students in Eastern European countries. Obviously, learning English is a big draw, but his pattern of student movement was unheard of five years ago.\nThe brain drain is a universal phenomenon, and countries that don\u2019t face up to the new reality will be losing some of their most precious resources. The northeast of England is its poorest region, and has experienced a severe loss of highly qualified professionals-to-be. Some of the most able 18-year-olds are going to other parts of Britain, even to other countries. What is happening here is happening to Britain as a whole. Most noticeably, there is a growing trend of British students taking degrees in American universities. This year the number will break the psychological barrier of 1,000 students for the first time.\nAnd what is happening at the secondary-school level is happening to higher education. Wherever they come from, today\u2019s students have a very different perspective on education from their parents. Because of television, the Internet and their travels, these students see the world as a much smaller place than their parents once did. They are more confident in accepting the challenge of moving from one country to another, from one culture to another; in many cases they can even apply to schools over the Internet. Students are also more aware of the overall cost of education and are looking for value for money. Plus, for many, education linked to travel is a better option than education at home.\n\u5c0f\u98981:\u00a0 Why does the author say education has become a global enterprise?\n\u5c0f\u98982: What can we infer about northeast England from the passage?\n\u5c0f\u98983: According to the passage, students today have different perspective from their parents on the following EXCEPT that _________________.\n\u5c0f\u98984: The students today tend to see the world as a much smaller place NOT because __________.\n\u5c0f\u98985: The purpose of the author in writing this passage is to __________.\n"},

So, as a police officer, I have some urgent things to say to good people. Day after day my men and I struggle to hold back a tidal wave of crime. Something has gone terribly wrong with our once-proud American way of life. It has happened in the area of values. A key ingredient is disappearing, and I think I know what it is: accountability.\nAccountability isn\u2019t hard to define. It means that every person is responsible for his or her actions and liable for their consequences.\nOf the many values that hold civilization together --- honesty, kindness, and so on --- accountability may be the most important of all. Without it, there can be no respect, no trust, no law --- and, ultimately, no society.\nMy job as a police officer is to impose accountability on people who refuse, or have never learned, to impose it on themselves. But as every policeman knows, external controls on people\u2019s behavior are far less effective than internal restraints such as guilt, shame and embarrassment.\nFortunately there are still communities --- smaller towns, usually --- where schools maintain discipline and where parents hold up standards that declare: \u201cIn this family certain things are not tolerated --- they simply are not done!\u201d\nYet more and more, especially in our larger cities and suburbs, these inner restraints are loosening. Your typical robber has none. He considers your property his property; he takes what he wants, including your life if you annoy him.\nThe main cause of this breakdown is a radical shift in attitudes. Thirty years ago, if a crime was committed, society was considered the victim. Now, in a shocking reversal, it\u2019s the criminal who is considered victimized: by his underprivileged (\u88ab\u5265\u593a\u57fa\u672c\u793e\u4f1a\u6743\u5229\u7684) upbringing, by the school that didn\u2019t teach him to read, by the church that failed to reach him with moral guidance, by the parents who didn\u2019t provide a stable home.\nI don\u2019t believe it. Many others in equally disadvantaged circumstances choose not to engage in criminal activities. If we free the criminal, even partly, from accountability, we become a society of endless excuses where no one accepts responsibility for anything. We in America desperately need more people who believe that the person who commits a crime is the one responsible for it..\n\u5c0f\u98981:What the wise man said suggests that it\u2019s __________.\n\u5c0f\u98982: According to the author, if a person is found guilty of a crime, ________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:\u00a0 Compared with those in small towns, people in large cities have ________.\n\u5c0f\u98984: The writer is sorry to have noticed that ________.\n\u5c0f\u98985: The key point of the passage is that ________.\n"},

Celebrated on the day following the full moon, this year\u2019s festival happens to be on March 19th.\nAs with most Indian festivals, this one also has many different folk stories. Most of them center around the success of good over evil. The most popular one is about a king, who hates his son Prahlada for loving the creator of the Universe\u2014Lord Vishnu. When every attempt to stop him fails, his sister, Holika believed to be immune(\u514d\u75ab\u7684) to fire, joins in the effort by inviting the young boy to sit with her inside a huge fire. Helped by the power of Lord Vishnu, Prahlada escapes safely, while the evil Holika is burned to death. To remember this event, huge outdoor fires are lit in the night before Holi in order to clean the air of evil spirits and to celebrate the death of the evil.\nSo what\u2019s so great about this day? While there are some fun parades(\u6e38\u884c) and folk songs and dance performances, the most fun of all is walking to the streets and splashing(\u6cfc\u6d12) people with water guns and dry colors and even covering them with entire buckets of colored water.

Researchers believe this may be caused by social pressure.\n In a New York Times article, Sam Boakye \u2013 the only black student on his freshman year floor -said that \"if you're surrounded by whites, you have something to prove.\"\n Researchers also observed problems resulting from pairing interracial students in residences.\n According to two recent studies, randomly assigned roommates of different races are more likely to experience conflicts so strained that one roommate will move out.\n An Indiana University study found that interracial roommates were three times as likely as two white roommates to no longer live together by the end of the semester.\n Grace Kao, a professor at Penn said she was not surprised by the findings. \"This may be the first time that some of these students have interacted, and lived, with someone of a different race,\" she said.\n At Penn, students are not asked to indicate race when applying for housing.\n \"One of the great things about freshman housing is that, with some exceptions, the process throws you together randomly,\" said Undergraduate Assembly chairman Alec Webley. \"This is the definition of integration.\"\n \"I've experienced roommate conflicts between interracial students that have both broken down stereotypes and reinforced stereotypes,\" said one Penn resident advisor (RA). The RA of two years added that while some conflicts \"provided more multicultural acceptance and melding (\u878d\u5408),\" there were also \"jarring cultural confrontations.\"\n The RA said that these conflicts have also occurred among roommates of the same race.\n Kao said she cautions against forming any generalizations based on any one of the studies, noting that more background characteristics of the students need to be studied and explained.\n\u5c0f\u98981:What can we learn from some recent studies?\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does Sam Boakye's remark mean?\n\u5c0f\u98983:What does Alec Webley consider to be the \"definition of integration\"?\n"},

Not only did people living in Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka \ndie, but many European tourists who were on holiday in these countries also died. Now, we are just beginning \nto understand how much damage was caused to the environment and to the economy. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The biggest problem after the tsunami has been illnesses which have spread to many people. These illnesses\nare mostly caused by a lack of clean drinking water. People are drinking dirty water because there is no other \nwater available. This dirty water is making them sick. Also, the hospitals in these poor countries are not big \nenough to deal with all the people who were hurt in the tsunami. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many people who live in the areas hit by the tsunami are farmers and fishermen. The tsunami destroyed \ntheir homes, their fields and their boats. The salt water from the ocean covered the farmers' fields, so they can\nno longer grow food. Also, fishermen are finding that there are fewer fish in the ocean. Now, these people, \nwho were already quite poor, have no way to earn money. No one knows how long it will take for the fish to\nreturn, or for the farmers to be able to grow food again. Tourism is also very important in these areas, but \nmany famous tourist areas are destroyed during the tsunami. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The whole world is helping these countries recover from the tsunami. Many governments have given aid \nmoney. UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, has set up 200 places where people can get help. It has\nalso provided clean drinking water. One organization called M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors without Borders)\nhas sent many doctors to care for sick people. In Indonesia, some government officials think that some villages\nshould be moved away from the ocean, and that farmers should learn how to grow different types of food. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No one knows how much money or how much time it will take for this area to recover completely. However,\nwith the help and aid that is being sent to the affected areas, hopefully it won't take long. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Disaster strikes South-east Asia\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n"},

When the government controls prices, there is no longer a normal relationship between the \nprice of a product and the quantity consumers will buy. Government controls may help in an emergency.\nHowever, some economists believe that the controls can have negative effects over a long period of time. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In cities with rent control, the city government sets the maximum rent that a landlord can charge for an\napartment. Supporters of rent control argue that it protects people who are living in apartments. Their rent \ncannot increase; therefore, they are not in danger of losing their homes. However, the critics say that after \na long time, rent control may have negative effects. Landlords know that they cannot increase their profits. \nTherefore, they invest in other businesses where they can increase their profits. They do not invest in new \nbuildings which would also be rent-controlled. As a result, new apartments are not built. Many people who \nneed apartments cannot find any. According to the critics, the end result of rent control is a shortage of \napartments in the city. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some theorists argue that the minimum wage law can cause problems in the same way. The federal \ngovernment sets the minimum that an employer must pay workers. The minimum helps people who generally\nlook for unskilled, low paying jobs. However, if the minimum is high, employers may hire fewer workers. \nThey will replace workers with machinery. The price which is the wage that employers want decreases. \nThus, the critics claim, an increase in the minimum wage may cause unemployment. Some poor people may \nfind themselves without jobs instead of with jobs at the minimum wage. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supporters of the minimum wage say that it helps people keep their dignity. Because of the law, workers \ncannot sell their services for less than the minimum. Furthermore, employers cannot force workers to accept\njobs at unfair wages. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economic theory predicts the results of economic decisions such as decisions about farm production, rent \ncontrol, and the minimum wage. The predictions may be correct only if \"other things are equal\". Economists \ndo not agree on some of the predictions. They also do not agree on the value of different decisions. Some \neconomists support a particular decision while others criticize it. Economists do agree, however, that there \nare no simple answers to economic questions. \n1. There is the possibility that setting maximum rent may ____. \nA. cause a shortage of apartments\nB. worry those who rent apartments as homes \nC. increase the profits of landlords \nD. encourage landlords to invest in building apartments \n2.

Or more likely when the second\u00adlast person who speaks it dies because then there is no one left to talk to. According to linguists (\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6) there is nothing unusual about a single language dying out. But what is happening today is quite remarkable. According to the recent statistics, there are approximately 6,000 languages in the world as we speak. Of these, about half are going to die out in the next century. \nThere are several reasons as to why a language can eventually die out. These range from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, to sociological factors, like cultural assimilation, in which the culture of a minority group is gradually replaced by a stronger one. The former can cause tribes to leave their natural habitat(\u6816\u606f\u5730) and therefore become fewer and fewer in number. However, it doesn't happen very frequently. In fact, the latter is a much bigger threat and it is responsible for the extinction of a lot of languages in countries like the USA and Australia. For instance, Chemehuevi is one of the languages which is really close to dying out since its sole speaker is an old, yet healthy, man named Johnny Hill, Jr. \nIt is very important for as many languages as possible to be preserved. Scientists have been trying to raise people's awareness on how certain tribes have specific words which cannot be expressed in let's say English simply because there is no equal meaning. Namely, the Yupik of Alaska have 99 names to describe different layers of ice formation, or how the Tofa of Siberia classify reindeer (\u9a6f\u9e7f). In other words, when languages die out, mankind's wisdom reduces. \nOn a happier note, there are many famous cases which show what can be done to preserve languages in danger of extinction. In particular, the Maori in New Zealand have created so\u00adcalled \u201clanguage nests\u201d\uff1a organizations which help children under five learn the language. They provide them with a setting where they are exposed to the language intensively so that they get to realise that communicating in Maori is as natural as communicating in English. There is always, of course, the risk that the children won't keep the language alive after they have left their \u201cnests\u201d. Nevertheless, hope dies hard.\n\u5c0f\u98981:What most probably caused the death of languages in the USA and Australia?\n\u5c0f\u98982:In Paragraph 3, the author states his opinion by ________ \n\u5c0f\u98983:What does the author really intends to tell us in the last paragraph?\n\u5c0f\u98984:The author believes that ________. \n"},

This holiday is much more important in some regions than in others (Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo being the biggest Sweetest Day cities). It is a holiday that is gaining in popularity every year throughout the country.\nSweetest Day is celebrated on the third Saturday in October as a day to make someone happy. It is an occasion which offers all of us an opportunity to remember not only the sick, aged, and orphaned, but also friends, relatives and associates whose helpfulness and kindness we have enjoyed.\nOver 60 years ago, a man in Cleveland, believing that the city's orphans and shut\u00adins (\u5367\u75c5\u5728\u5e8a\u7684\u4eba) too often felt forgotten and neglected, thought of the idea of showing them that they were remembered. He did this through the distribution of small gifts. With the help of his friends and neighbors, he distributed these small remembrances on a Saturday in October. During the years that followed, other Clevelanders began to participate in the celebration ceremony, which came to be called \u201cSweetest Day\u201d. In time, the Sweetest Day idea of spreading cheer to the underprivileged was broadened to include everyone, and became an occasion for remembering others with a kind act or a small remembrance. And soon the idea spread to other cities all over the country.\nSweetest Day is not based on any single group's religious affection or on a family relationship. It is a reminder that a thoughtful word or deed enriches life and gives it meaning.\nBecause for many people remembering takes the form of gift\u00adgiving, Sweetest Day offers us the opportunity to show others that we care, in a practical way. \n\u5c0f\u98981:We can learn from the first paragraph that Sweetest Day is ________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:Sweetest Day was intended to remember ________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:We can infer from the passage that the birthplace of Sweetest Day is ________. \n\u5c0f\u98984:Now on Sweetest Day gifts are given to those ________. \n"},

His girlfriend found it embarrassing and explained to him that what he was doing was not exactly fair. If he wanted to drink more tea, he should buy another cup.

Someone who keeps his nose to the grindstone (\u78e8\u77f3) works very hard. This can help a worker keep his nose clean or stay out of trouble.\nOne unusual expression is that is no skin off my nose. This means that a situation doesn\u2019t affect or concern me. We also say that sometimes a person cuts off his nose to spite his face. That is, he makes a situation bad for himself by doing something foolish because he is angry.\nMore problems can develop if a person looks down his nose at someone or something. The person acts as if something is unimportant or worthless. This person might also turn up his nose at something that he considers not good enough. This person thinks he is better than everyone else. He has his nose in the air.\nIn school, some students thumb their nose at their teacher. They refuse to obey orders or do any work.

Thrill-seekers like me are in luck because theme parks are pushing the boundaries of technology to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known.\n Alton Towers in Britain opened the world's first 14-1oop roller coaster a few months ago, called The Smiler. Over in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest one. Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride sends out passengers from 0-240km/h in just 4. 9 seconds. During this rapid acceleration they experience G-forces only fighter pilots usually\u00a0 feel: Up to 4. 8G. The designer of several rides at Alton Towers, said: \"While we can stand 6-8Gs for very short periods of\u00a0 time, ff we experience 5G for more than five seconds we're likely to \"black out.\"\n On modern roller coasters passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops. But while we may have reached the limit in terms of G-forces, there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go---it's all down to money. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost ~18m to build.\n Some companies are finding other ways to keep us amused. There's a move towards indoor rides where the experience is improved by audio-visual technologies. For example, a company called Dynamic Structures is currently developing a \"coal-mine-themed\" ride for a client in Dubai that will combine speed and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics, which will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling.\n I can't wait to enjoy this one.

However, there may be other reasons for example, economic (\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684) reasons-why they should be preserved. So, let us assume that historical buildings are both attractive and important to the majority of people. What should we do then if a new building is needed?\nIn my view, new architectural styles can exist perfectly well alongside an older style. Indeed, there are many examples in my own home town of Tours where modern designs have been placed very successfully next to old buildings. As long as the building in question is pleasing and does not dominate (\u5f71\u54cd) its surroundings too much, it often improves the attractiveness of the area.\nIt is true that there are examples of new buildings which have spoilt (\u7834\u574f) the area they are in, but the same can be said of some old buildings too. Yet people still speak against new buildings in historic areas. I think this is simply because people are naturally conservative(\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684)and do not like change.\nAlthough we have to respect people's feelings as fellow users of the buildings, I believe that it is the duty of the architect and planner to \n.

On the last night, the prince placed soothing sticky on the stairs; as Cinderella made her escape, a shoe got stuck on it.\nHere now is where the story becomes unpleasant: when the prince went to the house looking for the girl whose foot fit the shoe, the wicked(\u90aa\u6076\u7684) stepmother told one of her two daughters to cut off her big toe to fit into the shoe. The daughter did as told. So the prince took her away to be his bride. But when they passed the tomb of Cinderella\u2019s mother, the birds called out to the prince,\n\u201cTurn and peep, there\u2019s blood in the shoe;\nthe shoe is too small, the true bride waits for you.\u201d \nRealizing he had been tricked, the prince returned the daughter to her mother. The other then had to cut off part of her heel in order to fit into the shoe, with the same result. Only Cinderella\u2019s foot fit perfectly and so the prince chose to marry her. The story ends with the wedding day: as Cinderella\u2019s two stepsisters followed her, pretending to be devoted to her so that they could enjoy the king\u2019s riches, two birds flew by and plucked(\u5544) out their eyes. Because of their wickedness and falsehood, they had to spend the rest of their days blind.\nThe original Cinderella is so different from the Disney version. Thank goodness Disney made such changes; it indeed was a wise move.\n\u5c0f\u98981:What dose the underlined word \u201cThey\u201d in the first paragraph refer to?\n\u5c0f\u98982:How did Cinderella get her name?\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following is TRUE according to the original story?\n\u5c0f\u98984:The moral of the original story is that ____________.\n\u5c0f\u98985:What does the author think of the Disney version?\n"},

At a height of almost 310 metres, it is the tallest building in Europe. The Shard has completely changed the appearance of London. However, not everyone thinks that it is a change for the better.\nThe Shard was designed by the famous Italian architect Renzo Piano. When he began designing the Shard for London, Piano wanted a very tall building that looked like a spire (\u5c16\u9876)\u2022 He wanted the glass surfaces to reflect the sky and the city. The sides of the building aren\u2019t regular. So the building has an unusual shape. It looks like a very thin\uff0csharp piece of broken glass. And that is how the building got the name: the Shard. Piano says that the spire shape of the Shard is part of a great London tradition. The shape reminds him of the spires of the churches of London or the tall masts (\u6845\u6746\uff09of the ships that were once on the river Thames.\nThe Shard has 87 floors. At the top, there is an observatory. At the moment the building is empty, but eventually there will be a five-star hotel. There will also be top quality restaurants, apartments and offices.\nBefore building work began, a lot of people didn\u2019t want the Shard though the plans were approved. Now they are still unhappy about the Shard. Some critics say that such a tall skyscraper might be good in a city like New York, but not in London. They say that the best thing about the Shard is its spire shape. But that is the only thing. There is no decoration, only flat surfaces. The Egyptians did that 4,500 years ago. They also think the Shard is too big for London. It destroys the beauty of the city.\nOther critics don\u2019t like what the Shard seems to represent. They say that the Shard shows how London is becoming more unequal. Only very rich people can afford to buy the expensive private apartments and stay in the hotel. But the people who live near the Shard are among the poorest in London. So the Shard seems a symbol of the division in society between the very rich and the poor.\nThe Shard now dominates the London skyline. It is not certain, however, that ordinary London citizens will ever accept it as a valuable addition to the city.\n\u5c0f\u98981:London\u2019s newest skyscraper is called the Shard because of ._____\nA. its cost\nB\u00a0 its size\nC .its shape\nD .its height\n\u5c0f\u98982:When he designed the Shard, Piano wanted it to ._____\n\u5c0f\u98983:The critics who refer to social division think the Shard_______\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which would be the best title for the passage?\n"},

Some baboons were given the chance to watch another baboon who already knew how to solve the task, while others had to learn for themselves. To work out how brave or anxious the baboons were, Dr. Carter presented them either with a novel food or a threat in the form of a model of a poisonous snake.\nShe found that personality had a major impact on learning. The braver baboons learnt, but the shy ones did not learn the task although they watched the baboon perform the task of finding the novel food just as long as the brave ones did. In effect, despite being made aware of what to do, they were still too shy to do what the experienced baboon did.\nThe same held true for anxious baboons compared with calm ones. The anxious individuals learnt the task by observing others while those who were relaxed did not, even though they spent more time watching.\nThis \n between collecting social information and using it shows that personality plays a key role in social learning in animals, something that has previously been ignored in studies on how animals learn to do things. The findings are significant because they suggest that animals may perform poorly in cognitive (\u8ba4 \u77e5\u7684\uff09tasks not because they aren\u2019t clever enough to solve them\uff0cbut because they are too shy or nervous to use the social information.\nThe findings may impact how we understand the formation of culture in societies through social learning.

When one of his employees started crying after a customer screamed at her, Travis took her away. \"Your working uniform is your shelter,\" he told her. \"Nothing anyone says will ever hurt you. You will always be as strong as you want to be.\"\nTravis picked up that lecture in one of his G&G training courses, an education program that began on his first day and continues throughout an employee's occupation. The training has, Travis says, changed his life. G&G has taught him how to live, how to focus, how to get to work on time, and how to master his emotions (\u60c5\u7eea). Most importantly, it taught him willpower.\nAt the center of that education is an extreme focus on an all-important habit; willpower. Dozens of cases show that willpower is the single most important habit for a person's success.\n And the best way to strengthen willpower is to make it into a habit. \"Sometimes it looks like people with great self-control aren't working hard\u2014but that's because they've made it automatic,\" Angela Duckworth, one of the University of Pennsylvania researchers said. \"Their willpower occurs without them having to think about it.\"\n The company spent millions of dollars developing programs of study to train employees on self-control. Managers wrote workbooks that serve as guides to how to make willpower a habit in workers' lives.

They often stand close when talking and it is common for them to touch the person on the shoulder. People often greet each other (particularly women) with light cheek kisses. Schedules tend to be flexible, with business meetings sometimes starting later than planned. But to be safe, be on time. Meals can stretch for hours\u2014there\u2019s no such thing as rushing a meal in Brazil. Lunches also can start in the mid to late afternoon. Brazilians are social, preferring face-to-face communication over mails or phone calls.\nIn Singapore\nSingaporeans shake hands when they meet and often also greet each other with a small, polite bow. Business cards should be offered and received with two hands. Arriving late is considered disrespectful. So be on time. Efficiency(\u6548\u7387) is the goal, so meetings and dealings often are fast-paced. Singaporeans are direct in their discussions, even when the subject is about money. Rank is important and authority is respected. This determines both people interact in meetings. For example, people avoid disagreeing outright with someone with a higher rank.\nIn the United Arab Emirates\nIn the UAE, status is important, so the most senior or oldest should be greeted first with their titles. The handshake seems to be longer than elsewhere. So, do not pull away the handshake. Women should cover themselves when it comes to dress. Men also tend to be covered from neck to elbows(\u8098\u90e8) and down to the knees. People do not avoid entertaining in their homes, but they also hold business meals at restaurants. Touching or passing food or eating with your left hand is to be avoided. When meetings are one-to-one, if your host offers you coffee, you should refuse. It might seem odd, but it is a cultural tradition. Coffee should only be accepted if it is always set out or presented.\nIn Switzerland\nThe Swiss tend to be formal and address each other by last name. They also are respectful of private lives. You should be careful not to ask about personal topics. Punctuality (\u5b88\u65f6) is vital, something that comes from a deep respect for others\u2019 time. Arrive at any meeting or event a few minutes early to be safe. They also have clear structure in their companies. Higher-ups make the final decisions, even if others might disagree. Neat, clean dress is expected. The Swiss follow formal table manners. They also keep their hands visible at the table and their elbows off the table. It is polite to finish the food on your plate.\n\u5c0f\u98981:The passage is mainly about ________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why do Singaporeans avoid arguing with their boss?\n\u5c0f\u98983:In the UAE, when should you refuse the coffee if it is offered?\n\u5c0f\u98984:In which country do people care about where to put their hands at the dinner table?\n"},

Many experts have tried to make English easier for students to learn\u2015but they weren\u2019t always successful.\nIn 1930, Professor CK Ogden of Cambridge University invented Basic English. It had only 850 words (and just eighteen verbs) and Ogden said most people could learn it in just thirty hours. The problem was that people who learned Basic English could write and say simple messages, but they couldn\u2019t understand the answers in \u201creal\u201d English! It was also impossible to explain a word if it wasn\u2019t in the Basic English word list. For example, if you wanted a watermelon, you asked for \u201ca large green fruit with the form of an egg, which has a sweet red inside and a good taste\u201d! \nRE Zachrisson, a university professor in Sweden, decided that the biggest problem for learners of English was spelling, so he invented a language called Anglic. Anglic was similar to English, but with much simpler spelling. \u201cFather\u201d became \u201cfaadher\u201d, \u201cnew\u201d became \u201cnue\u2019 and \u201cyears\u201d became \u201cyeerz\u201d. Unfortunately for some students of English, Anglic never became popular.\nEven easier is the language which ships\u2019 captains use: it\u2019s called \u201cSeaspeak\u201d. Seaspeak uses a few simple phrases for every possible situation. In Seaspeak, for example, you don\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry what did you say?\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t understand, can you repeat that?\u201d It\u2019s just \u201cSay again.\u201d No more grammar!\nIn the age of international communication through the Internet who knows? ... a new form of English might appear.

The Pilgrims landed at what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620. They had a difficult time and the first winter was cruel. Many of the Pilgrims died. But the next year, they had a good harvest. So Governor Bradford declared a three-day feast\uff08\u76db\u5bb4\uff09. The Pilgrims invited Indian friends to join them for their special feast. Everyone brought food.In time, other colonies\uff08\u6b96\u6c11\u5730\uff09began to celebrate a day of thanksgiving. But it took years before there was a national Thanksgiving Day. During the Civil War, Sarah Josepha Hale persuaded Abraham Lincoln to do something about it. He proclaimed\uff08\u5ba3\u5e03\uff09the last Thursday of November 1863 as a day of thanksgiving.

The \nChinese states were very large and feudal, while the Greek city-states were small and urban. The urban\nenvironment in which Socrates lived allowed him to be more radical than Confucius. Unlike Confucius, \nSocrates was not asked by rules how to govern effectively. Thus, Socrates was able to be more idealistic, \nfocusing on issues like freedom, and knowledge for its own sake. Confucius, on the other hand, advised \nthose in government service, and many of his students went out to government service. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Confucius suggested the Golden Rule as a principle for the conduct of life:\"Do not do to others what you\nwould not want others to do to you.\" He assumed that all men were equal at birth, though some bad more\npotential than others, and that it was knowledge that set men apart. Socrates focused on the individual, and \nthought that the greatest purpose of man was to seek wisdom. He believed that the superior class should rule\nthe inferior (\u4e0b\u5c42\u7684) classes. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For Socrates, the family was of no importance, and the community of little concern.

You step into a cave. But instead of the dog, you find beautiful cave\n paintings. You see paintings of horses, deer, and bison (\u91ce\u725b) that are drawn in black, brown, red and yellow. \nYour first question would probably be\"Who did this?\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0This is what happened to four French boys in 1940. They found the Lascaux caves. The paintings the \nboys discovered in those caves are 17,000 years old. They were drawn by the ancient people called\n Cro-Magnons. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cro-Magnons looked much like people of today. They used tools, such as fishing nets that look familiar\n too. But their art was extremely good. The main cave at Lascaux is called the Great Hall of Bulls (\u516c\u725b ), \nwhich has a picture of bulls and horses in many colors. The largest animal is 18 feet long. There are smaller\n animals, such as bison, stags (\u7261\u9e7f) and a bear. There is also a strange spotted two-horned (\u4e24\u53ea\u89d2\u7684) animal. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To the left of the main cave are the most famous paintings that are the drawings of multicolored animals.\n One painting is called Little Horses. On the ceiling are horses and cows. The most unusual sight may be in the\n Shaft of the Dead Man where there is a thinoceros (\u7280\u725b), a carefully drawn dead man, a wounded bison and\n a bird. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why did Cro-Magnon artists do these beautiful drawings on cave walls? Did the drawings call upon some \nmagical power? Did the Cro-Magnon people hope that the drawings would bring luck? There is one thing the\n paintings seem to tell us.

Grain was the first domesticated crop that started that farming process. \nThe oldest proven records of brewing are about 6,000 years old and refer to the Sumerians. Sumeria lay between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers including Southern Mesopotamia. It is said that the Sumerians discovered the fermentation (\u53d1\u9175) process by chance. No one knows today exactly how this occurred, but it could be that a piece of bread or grain became wet and a short time later, it began to ferment. \nThe Sumerians were able to repeat this process and are assumed to be the first civilized culture to brew beer. They had discovered a \u201cdivine drink\u201d which certainly was a gift from the gods. The word beer comes from the Latin word bibere, meaning \u201cto drink\u201d, and the Spanish word cerveza originates from the Greek goddess of agriculture, Ceres. \nA vitamin-rich porridge, used daily, beer is reported to have increased health and longevity and reduced disease and malnutrition (\u8425\u517b\u4e0d\u826f). The self-medicating properties of alcohol-rich beer also eased the tensions and stresses of daily living in a hostile world. The use of yeast (\u9175\u6bcd) was not yet known at that time. The success of the fermentation process was left to chance, as the brewers unknowingly relied on yeast particles in the air. \nConsiderable scientific research took place in breweries (\u917f\u9152\u5382) in the 19th century. A famous work from 1876 by Louis Pasteur was Studies Concerning Beer where he revealed his knowledge of micro-organisms. By establishing that yeast is a living microorganism, Pasteur opened the gates for accurately controlling the conversion (\u8f6c\u6362) of sugar to alcohol. \nAnother discovery in beer brewing was the work of Christian Hansen, a Danish scientist, who successfully isolated a single yeast cell and induced it to reproduce on an artificial culture medium. With the resulting yeast multiplication (\u7e41\u6b96) methods, the purity of the fermenting process has been improved.\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to the passage, who was the first to brew beer?\n\u5c0f\u98982:The last two paragraphs mainly talk about \n.\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the text, which of the following is NOT true?\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which would be the best title for the text?\n"},

Men on Pentecost Island in the South Pacific have been doing land jumping for hundreds of years. The men tie long vines(\u85e4) from plants around their ankles\uff08\u8e1d\u5173\u8282\uff09. They spend days building tall towers out of vines and logs(\u5706\u6728). Then they jump off \nAccording to their beliefs, the first land diver was a woman. She decided to run away from her rude husband. So she climbed up a tall tree and tied some vines around her feet. Her husband also climbed up the tree and tried to catch her, but the woman jumped and the man followed. The vines saved her life, but her husband died.\nThis ancient custom caught the interest of some students at Oxford University in England. In the late 1970s, they formed a group called the Dangerous Sports Club. They were some of the first people to test several of what are now called extreme sports. They are said to have invented modern bungee jumping.\nIn the spring of 1979, members of the group jumped off the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, England. They were attached to the bridge by a bungee cord, a long elastic rope that stretches. The group soon received even more attention when they organized a bungee jump off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California.\nA man named A. J. Hackett of New Zealand decided to make the sport into a business. He started developing bungee ropes and material with a friend. They held a major jump in 1987 off the famous Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. They later got permission to open the first bungee jumping operation on the Kawarau Bridge in Queenstown, New Zealand. Many people paid 75 dollars to jump off the bridge with a bungee cord attached to their ankles.\n\u5c0f\u98981:The second paragraph tries to tell us________________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:The underlined word\n in the first paragraph refers to__________.\n\u5c0f\u98983: The Dangerous Sports Club first caught people\u2019s attention when they jumped off_________.\n"},

Around 1870, it was experiencing an economic(\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684)boom, and the capital, Buenos Aires, attracted many people. Farmers, as well as a flood of foreigners from Spain and Italy, came to Buenos Aires seeking jobs. These jobs didn\u2032t pay well, and the people felt lonely and disappointed with their new life in the city. As the unhappy newcomers mixed together in the poor parts of the city, the dance known an the tango(\u63a2\u6208\u821e)came into being\n At the beginning the tango was a dance of the lower classes. It was danced in the bars and streets. At that time there many fewer women than men, so if a man didn\u2032t want to be left out, his only choice was to dance with another man so that he could attract the attention of the few available women. Gradually, the dance spread into the upper classes of Argentinean society and became more respectable.\n In Europe at this time, strong interest in dance from around the world was beginning\nThe interest in international dance was especially evident in Paris. Every kind of dance from ballet(\u82ad\u857e\u821e)to belly dancing could be found on the stages of the Paris theaters of the Paris theaters. After tango dances from Argentina arrive in Europe, they began to draw the interest of the public an they performed their exiting dance in cafes, Though not everyone approved of the new dance, saying it was a little too shocking, the dance did find enough supporters to make it popular.\nThe popularity\uff08\u6d41\u884c\uff09Of the tango continued to grow in many other parts of the world.

It is possible that it grew out of the discovery that some people did certain kinds of work better than others did them. That led to the concept of specialization, which means that people would specialize, or focus, on doing one specific job.\n Let\u2019s take a man we\u2019ll call Mr. Fielder, for example. He did everything connected with farming. He planted seeds, tended the fields, and harvested and sold his crops. At the same time, he did many other jobs on the farm. However, he didn\u2019t make the bricks for his house, grind the wheat for his flour, or cut his trees into boards. He also did not make the plows(\u7281), the work boots, or any of the other hundreds of things a farm needs. Instead, he got them from people who specialized in doing each of those things.\n Suppose there was another man we shall call Mr. Plowright. Using what he knew about farming and working with iron, Mr. Plowright invented a plow that made farming easier. Mr. Plowright did not really like farming himself and wanted to specialize in making really good\u00a0 plows. Perhaps, he thought, other farmers will trade what they grow for one of my plows.\n How did Mr. Plowright let people know what he was doing? Why, he advertised, of course. First he opened a shop and then he put up a sign outside the shop to attract customers. That sign may have been no more than a plow carved into a piece of wood and a simple arrow pointing to the shop door. It was probably all the information people needed to find Mr. Plowright and his really good plows.\n Many historians believe that the first outdoor signs were used about five thousand years ago. Even before most people could read, they understood such signs. Shopkeepers would carve into stone, clay, or wood symbols for the products they had for sale.\n A medium, in advertising talk, is the way you communicate your message. You might say that the first medium used in advertising was signs with symbols. The second medium was audio, or sound, although that term is not used exactly in the way we use it today. Originally, just the human voice and maybe some kind of simple instrument, such as a bell, were used to get people\u2019s attention.\nA crier, in the historical sense, is not someone who weeps easily. It is someone, probably a man, with a voice loud enough to be heard over the other noises of a city. In ancient Egypt, shopkeepers might hire such a person to spread the news about their products. Often this primitive form of advertising involved a newly arrived ship loaded with goods. Perhaps the crier described the goods, explained where they came from, and praised their quality. His job was, in other words, not too different from a TV or radio commercial in today\u2019s world. \n\u5c0f\u98981:What probably led to the start of advertisement?\n\u5c0f\u98982:To advertise his plows, Mr. Plowright__________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:The writer makes up the two stories of Mr. Fielder and Mr. Plowright in order to___________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:In ancient Egypt, a crier was probably someone who_______________.\n\u5c0f\u98985:The last two paragraphs are mainly about_____________.\n"},

We may not depend so much on wild animals now. But we hear about them every day. Americans use the names of animals in many ways. Automobile manufacturers (\u5236\u9020\u5546) and gasoline companies especially like to use big cats to sell their products. They like lions, tigers and wildcats. When Americans say wildcat, they usually mean \n. All these cats attack quickly and fiercely. So wildcats represent something fast and fierce.\nAn early American use of the word wildcat was quite different. It was used to describe members of Congress who declared war on Britain in 1812. A magazine of that year said the wildcat congressmen went home. It said they were unable to face the responsibility of having involved their country in an unnecessary war.\nWildcat also has been used as a name for money. At that time, some states permitted banks to make their own money. One bank in the state of Michigan offered paper money with a picture of a wildcat on it. Some banks, however, did not have enough gold to support all the paper money they offered. So the money had little or no value. It was called a wildcat bill or a wildcat bank note.\nThe banks which offered this money were called wildcat banks. A newspaper of the time said those were the days of wildcat money. It said a man might be rich in the morning and poor by night.\nWildcat then was used for an oil well or gold mine that had almost no oil or gold in it. Dishonest developers would buy such property. Then they would sell it and leave town with the money. The buyers were left with worthless holes in the ground. Today, wildcat oil wells are in areas that are not known to have oil.\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the main idea of the passage?\n\u5c0f\u98982:From the passage we can know that ______.\n\u5c0f\u98983:The underlined words \u201ca lynx, an ocelot or a bobcat\u201din Paragraph 1 may refer to ______.\n\u5c0f\u98984:It can be inferred that during the days of wildcat money ______.\n"},

Between 1815 and 1914, the world witnessed the greatest peaceful migration in its history: 35 million people, mostly Europeans, left their homelands to start new lives in America. Why did these people risk everything by leaving their homes and families?\nFirst, what forced emigrants to make the decision to leave? One major cause for European farmers to leave was the rise in population which in turn led to land hunger. Another was politics. There was an increased taxation\uff08\u7a0e\u6536\uff09 and the growth of armies, and many young men fled eastern Europe to avoid being forced to join the army.\nPhysical hunger provided another pressing reason. Following the collapse \uff08\u8870\u9000\uff09of the economy of southern Italy in the 1860s, hundreds of thousands decided to start a new life in America. Religion also encouraged millions to leave the Old World.\nIn short, people chose to leave their homes for social, economic and religious reasons. As a result, by 1890 among a total population of 63 million, there were more than nine million foreign-born Americans.\nBut what were the attractions? First of all, there was the promise of land which was so scarce in Europe. Next, factories were calling for workers, and pay conditions were much better than back home. Men were needed to open up the West and build the long railroads, and new towns needed settlers to live in and to develop business. There was the space for religious people to practice their faith in peace.\nThis immigration meant that by around the 1850s Americans of non-English had started to be more than those of English. As we know, there were losers. To start with, there were those unwilling immigrants, the slaves who had been used as a source of cheap labour. Nor should we forget the equally unlucky American Indians. By 1860 there were 27 million free whites, four million slaves and a mere 488,000 free blacks.\nNowadays, the USA is still seen by millions as the Promised Land. As always, it remains an attractive place to those who think it will offer them a second chance.\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is not the cause for people to leave their homeland? \n\u5c0f\u98982:Why was life of the 19th Century European farmers difficult?\n\u5c0f\u98983: Which of the following was not an attraction of the USA?\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is the topic of this passage? \n\u5c0f\u98985: The American Indians __________.\n"},

In 1612, Shah Jehan married Mumtaz Mahal. Mad in love, they had 14 children over the next 20 years. But then sadness came. As Mumtaz was about to give birth to child number 14, she said she heard her unborn baby cry out. It was a sign of death. And as Mumtaz lay dying, she asked Jehan to build a lasting memorial (\u7eaa\u5ff5\u7269) to celebrate their love.\nThe heartbroken Jehan ordered his wife\u2019s dying wish carried out, and more than 20,000 workers worked nearly 22 years to complete the construction. In 1653, Jehan placed Mumtaz\u2019s remains under the center of the building.\n Later, son number five, Aurangzeb, murdered his brothers and took over the power from his aging father. Jehan lived the rest of his days, eight years, imprisoned not far from the Taj Mahal. Jehan was only allowed to climb onto the top of his prison to see the timeless treasure from a distance. But never again would he be allowed to visit it until he was buried next to his wife.\n Today 25,000 people visit the Taj Mahal each day.

They often refer to something being \u201cas American as baseball and apple pie\u201d. But is baseball really an American sport? And what are origins of baseball anyway?\nThe American game of baseball more than likely came from several European ball games. Russia had an early form of baseball and so did Germany and Romania. People in England played a game called \u201cstool ball\u201d. In this game, the pitcher(\u6295\u624b)tried to hit a stool(\u51f3\u5b50)or chair with a ball and the batter(\u51fb\u7403\u624b)used a stick to keep the ball away. But American baseball was most likely based on another English game, which is called \u201crounders\u201d. Players use a soft ball rater than a hard ball while playing rounders.\nSo when was the first real game of \u201cbaseball\u201d played? It seems that it took place in the 1840s. The father of baseball was Alexander Cartwright, who organized a baseball club in New York. Cartwright developed 20 rules that distinguished baseball from previous ball games.\nIn 1858, the first organized baseball league\u2014the National Association of Baseball players\u2014was formed. This league began charging fans to watch the games. However, the players were all amateurs and did not get paid . In 1869, the Cincinnati Red Stockings began to pay their players. Since they could hire the best players, Cincinnati won 57 games and lost none in their first season. As a result, other teams decided to hire players too. By 1871, the National Association was the first professional baseball league.\nToday baseball is liked very much in America. Top professional baseball players earn millions of dollars each year. There are two professional leagues\u2014the National League and the American League. The best teams from these two leagues compete for the baseball championship every year.\n\u5c0f\u98981:81.What do Americans think of baseball? (No more than 3 words)2\u2019\n\u5c0f\u98982:82.

We may not depend as much on wild animals now. But we hear about them every day. Americans use the names of animals in many ways.

All these cats attack quickly and fiercely. So wildcats represent something fast and fierce.\u00a0\u00a0\n An early American use of the word wildcat was quite different. It was used to describe members of Congress who declared war on Britain in 1812. A magazine of that year said the wildcat congressmen went home. It said they were unable to face the responsibility of having involved their country in an unnecessary war.\n Wildcat also has been used as a name for money in the 1800s. At that time, some states permitted banks to make their own money. One bank in the state of Michigan offered paper money with a picture of a wildcat on it. Some banks, however, did not have enough gold to support all the paper money they offered. So the money had little or no value. It was called a wildcat bill or a wildcat banknote. The banks who offered this money were called wildcat banks. A newspaper of the time said those were the days of wildcat money. It said a man might be rich in the morning and poor by night.\n Wildcat then was also used for an oil well or gold mine that had almost no oil or gold in it. Dishonest developers would buy such property. Then they would sell it and leave town with the money. The buyers were left with worthless holes in the ground.

The unofficial holiday commemorates the adoption of the stars-and-stripes design of the American flag by the Continental Congress 235 years ago, on June 14, 1777. According to lore, the Ross House is the birthplace of the nation\u2019s flag. That\u2019s open to debate, but it\u2019s a story that schoolbooks still tell. Betsy Ross was a \n, busy\u00a0 sewing cushions for chairs in Philadelphia, which was the focus place of the American revolution against British rule.

Most research indicates that Ross did sew the first flag. She\u2019s credited with substituting artful five-point white stars for six-pointed ones in the upper-left blue field. But many other accounts indicate George Washington brought the design to Ross and simply asked her to stitch it together. \u00a0\nIn a letter, Washington wrote: \u201cWe take the stars from Heaven, the red from our mother country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her.\u00a0 And the white stripes shall go down to posterity as representing liberty.\u201d \u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98981:People would like to go to Ross\u2019s house in Philadelphia to _____.\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which statement is true according to the passage?\n\u5c0f\u98983:The underlined the word \u201cseamstress\u201d in Paragraph 2 probably means_____.\n\u5c0f\u98984:What does the last paragraph imply according to the passage?\n"},

Countries also use animals as symbols. From eagles to lions, many countries use an animal to show its national spirit and character.\nThe image of an eagle is on the US President\u2019s flag, and on the one-dollar bill. The bald eagle is a large, powerful, brown bird with a white head and tail. The term \u201cbald\u201d does not mean that this bird lacks feathers. Instead, it comes from the old word piebald, that menas, \u201cmarked with white\u201d.\nThe US declared that the eagle was its national bird in 1782. It was chosen because of \u201cits long life, great strength, and noble looks\u201d.\nA few eagles have even become American heroes. An eagle named \u201cOld Abe\u201d, the mascot of a Wisconsin troop of soldiers during the Civil War, traveled 14,000 miles with its men. He was often shot at by the enemy, but survived 42 battles.\nBut, one of the Founding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin didn\u2019t agree with the choice. \u201cThe bald eagle \u2026 is a bird of bad moral character, like those among men who live by robbing, he is generally poor, and often very messy,\u201d he argued. Franklin wanted the turkey as the country\u2019s national bird.\nIf Americans chose their national symbol deliberately, the symbol of England arose out of history.\nKing Herry \u2160(1068-1135) was a brave warrior but also wise. His appreciation for the rule of law earned him the nickname the Lion of Justice. He was the first English King to use a lion as a royal symbol, which is popularly known as the \u201cking of the jungle\u201d. By the year Richard \u2160, known as \u201cThe Lionheart\u201d for his bravery, came to the throne in 1189, the famous Three Lions badge had been formed. Now it can be seen on the shirts of England\u2019s sports teams.\nAlthough people might not think of lions when they think of England, everyone knows about the Australian kangaroo. Legend has it that the kangaroo gets its name from an early meeting between local aborigines and white settlers. When asked by the Europeans what these strange-looking animals were, a native replied \u201ckangaroo\u201d, meaning \u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d\nThe kangaroo is an individualistic animal. Although it does gather in groups, the kangaroo is not a herd animal. If a group is attacked, individuals run off in different directions. Australians think the kangaroo represents positive values, such as individual responsibility and pride.\n\u5c0f\u98981:The general idea of this passage should probably be __________ .\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which is NOT true about the animal of the \u201cbald eagle\u201d?\nA.

But for about 90 percent of chocolate\u2019s long history, it was strictly a beverage (\u996e\u6599), and sugar didn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\nThe Origin of Chocolate \nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older. \nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe prove that the earliest linguistic (\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7684) evidence of chocolate consumption dates back three or even four thousand years.\nValuable and Fashionable Chocolate Beverage \nIt\u2019s hard to discover exactly when chocolate was born, but it\u2019s clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\nSweetened chocolate didn\u2019t appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled (\u54c1\u5c1d) the native cuisine. Chocolate didn\u2019t suit the foreigners\u2019 taste at first \u2014 one described it in his writings as \u201ca bitter drink for pigs\u201d \u2014 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal functions. But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s.\nThe Birth of Solid Chocolate\nIn 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate. His product became known as \u201cDutch cocoa\u201d, and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. In 1847, Joseph Fry created the first modern chocolate bar. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later.\nProsperous Chocolate Industry \nIn America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was used instead of wages. Even now, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force.

These days, certain perfumes are considered comparable to great works of art. Here are a few of the most famous perfumes in history.\nChanel No.5\nThis perfume is probably the best-selling scent (\u6c14\u5473) in the history of fragrance (\u9999\u6c34). Created by Ernst Beaux for Coco Chanel in 1921, it has been described as \u201cthe world\u2019s most legendary fragrance\u201d, and remains the company\u2019s most famous perfume.\nShalimar\nJacques Guerlain created this vanilla (\u9999\u8349) fragrance in 1925. The perfume takes its name from the Garden of Shalimar, which was built by Emperor Shah Jehan for one of his wives. It was an immediate hit in 1925 and is still extremely popular today.\nJoy\nJoy is famous for having been the most expensive perfume in the world at one point. It was created in 1930 by Henri Alm\u00e9ras for Jean Patou to lift the bad mood that had swept over the world after the 1929 stock market crash.\nL\u2019Air duTemps\nFrancis Farbon created Nina Ricci\u2019s L\u2019Air du Temps in 1948. The fragrance is known for its spicy (\u9999\u7684) carnation (\u5eb7\u4e43\u99a8) and gardenia (\u6800\u5b50) scents as well as its beautiful crystal (\u6c34\u6676\u7684) bottle (designed by Lalique).\nEternity\nCalvin Klein\u2019s second perfume was created by Sophia Grojsman in 1988. Known for its light, flowery scent, the perfume was listed in the Fragrance Hall of Fame in 2003. It is recommended for daytime wear.\nAngel\nThis wildly popular perfume was created in 1992 by Olivier Cresp for Thierry Mugler. The perfume was an instant success. The perfume has often been described as \u201cdelicious\u201d, owing to its chocolatey (\u5de7\u514b\u529b\u5473\u7684) scent. The perfume comes in beautiful star-shaped bottles.

He wants to know about the history of Alcatraz Island and the prison that once operated there.\nAlcatraz Island is in the harbor of San Francisco, California. It is best known for being a federal prison, which was also called \u201cThe Rock.\u201d It was once the most famous prison in America. \nAlcatraz was a military prison from the late eighteen fifties until the nineteen thirties. Then it became a federal prison for the country\u2019s worst criminals. These included murderers, bank robbers and kidnappers. One of the main reasons federal officials chose Alcatraz Island to detain these prisoners was because they thought it would be impossible for prisoners to escape.\nCold, deep and dangerous waters surround the island. Also, the distance between the island and San Francisco is too far for most humans to swim. No prisoner was ever officially reported to have successfully escaped.\nHowever, in nineteen sixty-two, three men broke out of the prison. Each man worked very hard at night for many months to cut through the stone wall of his cell. They made false heads out of paper, paint and hair. On the night of June eleventh, the men placed the heads in their beds to make it look as if they were sleeping. Then, the prisoners escaped through the holes in their cells to get to the water. The men were never seen or heard from again. It is believed that they drowned while trying to swim to San Francisco.\nThe prison closed in nineteen sixty-three because of the high cost of keeping prisoners there and the need for major repairs. The last prisoners were moved to other jails. \nIn nineteen seventy-two, the United States Congress passed a bill creating the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Alcatraz Island and the old prison are part of this area.\nEach year, more than one million people visit Alcatraz to see the prisoners\u2019 cells and listen to stories about the jail\u2019s history. But unlike the prisoners who once lived there, visitors can escape from the prison whenever they want and return back across the harbor to San Francisco.\n\u5c0f\u98981:The text mainly tells us________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why did federal officials make Alcatraz the most famous prison in America?\n\u5c0f\u98983:Paragraph 5 is written to ________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:Now Alcatraz ________.\n"},

It was the ancient Greeks who started the tradition by celebrating their annual spring festival in honor of Rhea, the mother of many gods and goddesses.\nLater, in the 1600s, Mothering Sunday came to be celebrated in England. On the fourth Sunday of Lent (\u5927\u658b\u671f), children brought flowers and special fruitcakes to show their respect for their mothers. It may be the root of the modern Mother\u2019s Day.\nThanks to the great efforts of Julia Ward Howe and Anna Jarvis, Mother\u2019s Day became an official festival in the US. It is celebrated on the second Sunday in May. Later, many countries began to celebrate this day as Mother\u2019s Day.\nToday, Mother\u2019s Day is an international festival honoring mothers. It is celebrated all over the world in different ways. In Western countries\uff0cthe most common way is to treat mothers with breakfast in bed .Kids often allow their mothers to sleep till late in the morning while they prepare her favorite breakfast with their fathers. Some also make hand\u00admade gifts or buy beautiful carnations (\u5eb7\u4e43\u99a8). It is the day when you acknowledge your mothers contribution in your life and pay a tribute (\u793c\u54c1) to her, often with flowers and gifts. It complements Father\u2019s Day, the celebration honoring fathers.\nToday, Mother\u2019s Day is a day celebrated on various days in many places around the world.\n\u5c0f\u98981:Why do people across the world celebrate Mother\u2019s Day?\n\u5c0f\u98982:The modern Mother\u2019s Day came from________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:From the passage we can learn that________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:The passage mainly wants to tell us________.\n"},

As a doctor, mother and scientist in child development, I believe there is nothing to recommend it, from the baby\u2019s point of view.\nMothers, doctors and nurse alike have no idea of where a baby\u2019s blood sugar level lies. All we know is that a low level is harmful to brain development and makes a baby easily annoyed. In this state, the baby is difficult to calm down and sleep is impossible. The baby asks for attention by crying and searching for food with its mouth.\nIt is not just unkind but also dangerous to say a four-hourly feeding schedule will make a baby satisfied. The first of the experts to advocate a strict clock-watching schedule was Dr Frederic Truby King who was against feeding in the night. I\u2019ve never heard anything so ridiculous. Baby feeding shouldn\u2019t follow a timetable set by the mum. What is important is feeding a baby in the best way, though it may cause some inconvenience in the first few weeks.\nWell, at last we have \n research that supports demand feeding and points out the weaknesses of strictly timed feeding. The research finds out that babies who are fed on demand do better at school at age 5, 7, 11 and 14, than babies fed according to the clock. By the age of 8, their IQ scores are four to five percent higher than babies fed by a rigid timetable. This research comes from Oxford and Essex University using a sample\uff08\u6837\u672c\uff09of 10,419 children born in the early 1990s, taking account of parental education, family income, a child\u2019s sex and age, the mother\u2019s health and feeding style. These results don\u2019t surprise me. Feeding according to schedule runs the risk of harming the rapidly growing brain by taking no account of sinking blood sugar levels.\nI hope this research will put an end to advocating strictly timed baby feeding practices.\n\u5c0f\u98981:What does the author think about Dr King?\n\u5c0f\u98982:The word \n in Paragraph 4 is closest in meaning to __________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:What does the research tell us about feeding a baby on demand?\n\u5c0f\u98984:The author supports feeding the baby __________.\n"},

Why is there such a huge achievement gap between urban \nand suburban students? Just this week, in my school the seventh grade team leader called a meeting to \ndiscuss academic detention (\u653e\u5b66\u540e\u7559\u6821). The purpose of the detention is to allow students who are \ndoing poorly a second chance to redo the work. Now if a student did not understand an assignment I have no trouble allowing that student to redo a test or give some extra credit work, but if a student did poorly \nbecause he/she opted(\u9009\u62e9) not to do the work out of sheer laziness, that student should not be given a\u00a0\nsecond chance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And parents should be held accountable for their children. That is another reason why there is such a \nhuge achievement gap. All children should be monitored at home in order to achieve great success in \nschool. Perhaps it might be a great idea for urban school districts to offer free classes to parents on how to help their students at home. Of course this idea is far fetched, after all we do not want to offend the\nparents.

Exploring postcollege choices\n looks a lot like being lost; in fact, being lost is normal and productive at this stage in life. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the past, people were penalized(\u5904\u7f5a)for getting lost. For example, dropping out of high school \nfor a year to explore made colleges think you were hospitalized for mental instability. But it's a different\n story today. Right after college, you don't get dinged(\u6559\u8bad)for taking time off. Most graduate and\n professional schools today would prefer the students who take time to go away, have different \nexperiences, and then come back refocused. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why is there so much respect for exploration?Part of the reason is that there is no better way of \nfiguring out what will make you happy. \"We are not very good at using our imaginations when it comes\n to how we'll feel in a given circumstance,\" says Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard \nUniversity. Therefore, he recommends that we test out a lot of different careers. He admits that this\n method takes time, but he says it's worth it because otherwise you're likely to make a decision based \non money, which does not always lead to happiness. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What about the people who pull their life together in a tight little package by age twenty-four?\nThey're the exception to the rule, according to Wayne Osgood, a professor of sociology at Pennsylvania \nState University. He labels these people \"fast starters\" and explains that they are only about 12 percent\n of the population. Some fast starters are just plain lucky: they love the first job they get after college. \nThe other 88 percent of us have to march through our twenties formulating(\u89c4\u5212)a new career plan. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The good news is that this is what most people are doing in their twenties:wandering, taking trips,\n changing jobs every year, volunteering for unpaid work while living at their parents' house, and starting \nbusinesses that fail. All these choices are, surprisingly, right on track for making a good decision about \nwhat to do with yourself in adult life. \n1. According to the passage, exploring after college in your twenties __________. \nA. means you get lost in your life\nB. assists you in choosing a suitable career\nC. is just a waste of your valuable time\nD. is a kind of mental instability\n2. Exploration is so much respected because __________. \nA. it helps you to earn much more money than others\nB. it improves your imagination in a given situation\nC. it is the best way to find your happiness\nD. it promises you various choices of careers\n3. Who can be called \"fast starters\" ?\nA. People who find their favorite jobs earlier. \nB. People who stand out among others. \nC. People who love their jobs very much. \nD.

Call it the piggy bank strategy(\u7b56\u7565). There are lessons in that time-honored coin-saving container.\n Any huge task seems easier when reduced to baby steps. I f you wished to climb a 12,000-foot mountain, and could do it a day at a time, you would only have to climb 33 feet daily to reach the top in a year. If you want to take a really nice trip in 10 years for a special occasion, to collect the $15,000 cost, you have to save $3.93 a day. If you drop that into a piggy bank and then once a year put $1,434 in a savings account at 1% interest rate after-tax, you will have your trip money.\n When I was a child, my parents gave me a piggy bank to teach me that, if I wanted something, I should save money to buy it. We associate piggy banks with children, but in many countries, the little containers are also popular with adults. Europeans see a piggy bank as a sign of good fortune and wealth. Around the world, many believe a gift of a piggy bank on New Year\u2019s Day brings good luck and financial success. Ah, but you have to put\u00a0\n\u00a0in it.\n Why is a pig used as a symbol of saving? Why not an elephant bank, which is bigger and holds more coins? In the Middle Ages, before modern banking and credit instruments, people saved money at home, a few coins at a time dropped into a jar or dish. Potters(\u5236\u9676\u5de5) made these inexpensive containers from an orange-colored clay(\u9ecf\u571f) called \u201cpygg,\u201d and folks saved coins in pygg jars.The Middle English word\nfor pig was \u201cpigge\u201d. While the Saxons pronounced pygg, referring to the clay, as \u201cpug\u201d, eventually the two words changed into the same pronunciation, sounding the \u201ci\u201d as in pig or piggy. As the word became less associated with the orange clay and more with the animal, a clever potter fashioned a pygg jar in the shape of a pig, delighting children and adults. The piggy bank was born.\n Originally you had to break the bank to get to the money, bringing in a sense of seriousness into savings. While piggy banks teach children the wisdom of saving, adults often need to relearn childhood lessons. Think about the things in life that require large amounts of money--- college education, weddings, cars, medical care, starting a business, buying a home, and fun stuff like great trips. So when you have money, take off the top 10%, put it aside, save and invest wisely.\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the piggy bank strategy?\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why did the writer\u2019s parents give him a piggy bank as a gift?\n\u5c0f\u98983:What does then underlined word \u201csomething\u201d(Paragraph 3) most probably refer to?\n\u5c0f\u98984:The piggy ban originally was _________.\n\u5c0f\u98985:The last paragraph talks about ________.\n"},

Most of the parts of your body still work great, you have a full head of hair, you\u2019re energetic, and you have a world of opportunity in front of you. However, there\u2019s going to come a time when you start to get older. And as you get older, you\u2019ll have new responsibilities, complete independence, and perhaps most importantly, less time to recover from mistakes.\nYou see, we all make mistakes in life. Maybe you spent more money than you should have on a car, you passed up on a great job opportunity, or you didn\u2019t try as hard as you could have in school. It\u2019s a part of life and we learn from it. But there are certain mistakes that are much better made while you\u2019re still young and have plenty of time to recover.\nI\u2019m definitely not telling you that you should purposely go out and make these mistakes (because they\u2019re a pain to recover from). But these are all mistakes that are much better made when you\u2019re younger so that you can learn from them and not have them ruin your entire life.\nStarting the wrong career\nWouldn\u2019t you hate to be 45 years old and discover that you absolutely hate what you do for a living? It\u2019s a reality that a lot of people face and it can be difficult to fix. You see, when you\u2019re 23 and find out you don\u2019t like the career path you\u2019ve chosen, you can easily explore new career options.\nWe no longer live in an age when people are expected to stay with one company until they retire. You can bounce around a little bit and find out what you want to do. When you get older, just switching careers whenever you want isn\u2019t as simple.\nYou have to consider your family, retirement, the difficulties you might run into with starting from the bottom in a new industry, and plenty of other issues that someone in their early 20\u2019s just doesn\u2019t have to deal with.\nDating the wrong person\nThe divorce rate in the U.S is extremely high. Other parts of the world aren\u2019t doing too much better either. While everyone gets divorced for their own reasons, I think we can all agree that it\u2019s better to find out that the person you\u2019re with is wrong for you sooner rather than later.\nHopefully you find out whether or not the person you\u2019re with is right for you before you tie the knot, because around 50% of first marriages end in divorce.\nMessing up your credit\nRuining your credit is never a good idea. Even if you ruin it while you\u2019re young, it could affect you in the future. The upside of having bad credit while you\u2019re young instead of older is that you have time to build it back up.\nIt can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy. During those 7-10 years, you\u2019ll have a hard time financing anything unless you have a cosigner or put down a substantial down payment.\nMost people tend to make most of the bigger purchases in life when they get older such as a house or their dream car. If you have bad credit, you can kiss all of that goodbye.\nMaking bad investments\nIf you\u2019re investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you\u2019ll be working your entire life. Whether you choose to pay someone to do the investing for you or handle it all yourself, it\u2019s a lot better to take risks when you\u2019re younger.\nIf you invest in stock or even real estate while you\u2019re young and the market takes a hit, you\u2019re not ruined. Investing is a long-term venture, so the younger you start, the more fluctuation you can withstand and still come out with a positive return.\nBlowing your money\nWhat would you do if you went broke at 60 years old? You would be working your behind off when you really should be relaxing and getting ready to retire soon.\nBut if you\u2019re 25 and broke, you still have plenty of time to earn more money. Also, nobody will judge you because it\u2019s not unusual for people in their 20\u2019s to not have money these days.

Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear \u2013 road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser(\u6d53\u7a20). At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there\u2019s a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply.\nTreiber\u2019s model of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d(\u627f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b)at each point on the route.\nThis allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions \u2013 for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves.\nTreiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided \u2013 and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers consulted Treiber\u2019s team, and eventually chose this option.\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the worst thing while running a marathon?\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which of the following statements is true?\n\u5c0f\u98983:What is NOT true about the Rennsteig?\n\u5c0f\u98984:What\u2019s the main idea of the passage?\n"},

But it doesn\u2019t come from Hollywood\u2014it\u2019s Hallyu(\u97e9\u6d41), the wave of Korean pop culture that has washed over Asia. It has influenced everything from music to television. And thanks to the Internet and social media, it\u2019s now spreading worldwide.\nSouth Korea produces all types of entertainment, the most popular being music, soap operas and films. What makes Hallyu so hot in Asia? One reason is that its products are of high quality and much cheaper than western products. Another reason is that eastern cultures are similar to each other, although there are language differences.\nKorean pop music, or \u201cK-pop\u201d, ranks the first\u00a0everywhere. Fans love the songs and the attractive stars. Companies like SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment help many K-pop stars, such as Super Junior, Big Bang and Rain, to succeed. They are not only popular in Asia but also enjoy popularity in the West. In 2011, Big Bang\u2019s mini-album Tonight reached the top 10 on U.S. Tunes Top Pop Albums. When SM Entertainment took their 2010 world tour to Los Angeles, only 30 percent of the 15,000 fans were Korean. Half of the audience wasn\u2019t even Asian!\nOne important reason for the success of Hallyu is simply the Internet. A little more than 10 years ago, Korean soap operas, movies and music reached the outside world quite slowly. They began in Korea, and then gradually spread outward, appearing in its neighboring countries where local TV and radio companies would play them. Now they are played around the world online at the same time.\nYouTube is another major way to get Korean entertainment to fans everywhere.

These cards are more secure than the traditional magnetic-strip version and can be used to travel on buses, check bank accounts and do shopping.\nThe Manchester project is one of the biggest smart card schemes in the world. Every time people use the cards on a bus or train, the fare is deducted (reduced) from the value of the card. When they have no credit left, the cards can be recharged at a local shop.\nA smart card looks just like a normal plastic card but it has a silicon chip in it. It is possible for the same silicon chip to perform a number of different functions, so one plastic card in your pocket could do a large number of different jobs. The card has much more memory space than a magnetic-strip card, so many more things can be recorded on it.There are two types of smart cards. One is the contact card which is used in the same way as a magnetic-strip card.\nInformation is transferred by running the card through a narrow opening in an electronic reader. In the slot, electronic probes make contact with the magnetic-strip or silicon ship and read the information. The other type is the contactless smart card where the electronic reader communicates with the card by short-range radio waves. This makes the card quicker and more convenient to use because it does not have to leave your wallet.\u00a0 It is also more reliable as it is not easily influenced by scratches or dirt. However, the biggest advantage that smart cards have over magnetic-strip cards is that they are more secure. They are much more difficult to make than conventional cards and they have to be made by specially trained manufacturers.

The line of thought involved in this shift can be pursued further. Imagine a person who is about the right weight, but does not eat very nutritious (\u6709\u8425\u517b\u7684) foods, who feels OK but exercises only occasionally, who goes to work every day, but is not an outstanding worker, who drinks a few beers at home most nights but does not drive while drunk, and who has no chest pains or abnormal blood counts, but sleeps a lot and often feels tired. This person is not ill. He may not even be at risk for any particular disease. But we can imagine that this person could be a lot healthier.\nThe field of medicine has not traditionally distinguished between someone who is merely \u201cnot ill\u201d and someone who is in excellent health and pays attention to the body\u2019s special needs. Both types have simply been called \u201cwell\u201d. In recent years, however, some health specialists have begun to apply the terms \u201cwell\u201d and \u201cwellness\u201d only to those who are actively striving to maintain and improve their health. People who are well are concerned with nutrition and exercise, and they make a point of monitoring their body\u2019s condition. Most important, perhaps, people who are well take active responsibility for all matters related to their health. Even people who have a physical disease or handicap (\u7f3a\u9677) may be \u201cwell\u201d in this new sense, if they make an effort to maintain the best possible health they can in the face of their physical limitations. \u201cWellness\u201d may perhaps best be viewed not as a state that people can achieve, but as an ideal that people can strive for. People who are well are likely to be better able to resist disease and to fight disease when it strikes.

This might be called laziness, but \nDr. Kleitman has a new explanation. He has proved that everyone has a daily energy cycle.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the hours when you labour through your work you may say that you're \"hot\". That's true. \nThe time of day when you feel most energetic is when your cycle of body temperature is at its peak.\n For some people the peak comes during the forenoon. For others it comes in the afternoon or evening.\n No one has discovered why this is so, but it leads to such familiar monologues (\u81ea\u8a00\u81ea\u8bed) as: \"Get up,\n John! You'll be late for work again!\" The possible explanation to the trouble is that John is at his \ntemperature-and-energy peak in the evening. Much family quarrelling ends when husbands and wives \nrealize what these energy cycles mean, and which cycle each member of the family has.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You can't change your energy cycle, but you can learn to make your life fit it better. Habit can help, \nDr. Kleitman believes. Maybe you're sleepy in the evening but feel you must stay up late anyway. \nCounteract (\u5bf9\u6297) your cycle to some extent by habitually staying up later than you want to. If your \nenergy is low in the morning but you have an important job to do early in the day, rise before your usual \nhour. This won't change your cycle, but you'll get up steam (\u9f13\u8d77\u5e72\u52b2) and work better at your low \npoint. Get off to a slow start which saves your energy. Get up with a leisurely yawn and stretch. Sit on\n the edge of the bed a minute before putting your feet on the floor.

Both men have hearing damage from exposure to loud music, and both now wear hearing aids as a consequence. As a teenager, Clinton played saxophone in a band. Townshend, who has the more severe hearing loss, was a guitarist for a band called the Who. He is one of the first rock musicians to call the public's attention to the problem of hearing loss from exposure to loud music.\n Temporary hearing loss can happen after only 15 minutes of listening to loud music. One early warning sign is when your ears begin to feel warm while you listen to music at a rock concert or through headphones. One later is that an unusual sound or a ringing is sometimes produced in your head after the concert.\n \"What happens is that the hair cells in the inner ear are damaged, but they're not dead,\" says physician and ear specialist Dr. Sam Levine. According to Dr. Levine, if you avoid further exposure to loud noise, it's possible to \n the cells somewhat. However, he adds, \"Eventually, over a long period of time, hair cells are permanently damaged.\" And this is no small problem.\n What sound level is dangerous? According to Dr. Levine, regular exposure to noise above 85 decibels (\u5206\u8d1d) is considered dangerous. The chart below offers a comparison of decibel levels to certain sounds. Here's another measurement you can use. If you're at a rock concert and the music is so loud that you have to shout to make yourself heard, you' re at risk for hearing loss. That's when wearing protective devices such as earplugs becomes critical.\n The facts are pretty frightening. But are rock bands turning down the volume.'? Most aren't. \"Rock music is supposed to be loud,\" says drummer Andrew Sather.\u00a0 \"I wouldn't have it any other way. And neither would the real fans of rock. \"\nContinued exposure to loud music and the failure to wear earplugs can lead to deafness, according to Dr. Levine. He states, \"There's no cure for hearing loss. Your ears are trying to tell you something. That ringing is the scream of your hair cells dying. Each time that happens, more and more damage is done. \"\n\u5c0f\u98981:From Paragraph 1, we can learn that \n.\n\u5c0f\u98982:In Paragraph 3, the underlined word \"recondition\" means \n.\n\u5c0f\u98983:The purpose of the chart at the end of the article is to show \n.\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following statements will Dr. Sam Levine probably agree?\n"},

These three infectious diseases killed almost 6 million people last year. That is about 10 percent of the total number of deaths around the world last year.\n The WHO and UN agencies released a new report at the World Economic Forum in New York City earlier this month. The document says that deaths around the world from malaria and tuberculosis could be cut in half by the year 2010. It also says the number of deaths from AIDS could be reduced 25 percent within that same time period.\n The report is called \u201cCalling Up the Response to Infectious Diseases.\u201d It calls for huge new investments in methods to prevent and treat infectious diseases. Officials say money is needed for research and to purchase drugs. Money is also needed to devices to prevent diseases, such as bed nets. Bed nets prevent mosquitoes that carry malaria from biting people while they sleep.\n David Heymann, director of the infectious disease program at the World Health Organization, says that providing effective drug treatments is important for improving peoples\u2019 health and economic well \u2013 being. Reducing disease can also help improve economic growth in developing countries.\n The WHO report also describes successful health programs in developing countries. In Peru, for example, the number of tuberculosis cases was cut in half by increasing the treatment to control the disease. In Vietnam, malaria was reduced 97 percent through the use of bed nets. And in Uganda, cases of the virus that causes AIDS were cut in half among pregnant women and children through the use of anti \u2013 AIDS drugs.\n This new international health campaign is estimated to cost about 12,000 million dollars a year. So far, officials say the campaign has about 2,000 million dollars.

We may speak contemptuously of the poor old Romans because they relished the orgies of slaughter that went on in their arenas. We may despise them because they mistook these goings on for entertainment. We may forgive them condescendingly because they lived 2000 years ago and obviously knew no better. But are our feelings of superiority really justified? Are we any less blood-thirsty? Why do boxing matches, for instance, attract such universal interest? Don\u2019t the spectators who attend them hope they will see some violence? Human beings remains as bloodthirsty as ever they were. The only difference between ourselves and the Romans is that while they were honest enough to admit that they enjoyed watching hungey lions tearing people apart and eating them alive, we find all sorts of sophisticated arguments to defend sports which should have been banned long age; sports which are quite as barbarous as, say, public hangings or bearbaiting.\nIt really is incredible that in this day and age we should still allow hunting or bull-fighting, that we should be prepared to sit back and watch two men batter each other to pulp in a boxing ring, that we should be relatively unmoved by the sight of one or a number of racing cars crashing and bursting into flames. Let us not deceive ourselves. Any talk of \u2018the sporting spirit\u2019 is sheer hypocrisy. People take part in violent sports because of the high rewards they bring. Spectators are willing to pay vast sums of money to see violence. A world heavyweight championship match, for instance, is front page news. Millions of people are disappointed if a big fight is over in two rounds instead of fifteen. They feel disappointment because they have been deprived of the exquisite pleasure of witnessing prolonged torture and violence.\nWhy should we ban violent sports if people enjoy them so much? You may well ask. The answer is simple: they are uncivilized. For centuries man has been trying to improve himself spiritually and emotionally \u2013 admittedly with little success. But at least we no longer tolerate the sight madmen cooped up in cages, or public floggings of any of the countless other barbaric practices which were common in the past. Prisons are no longer the grim forbidding places they used to be. Social welfare systems are in operation in many parts of the world. Big efforts are being made to distribute wealth fairly. These changes have come about not because human beings have suddenly and unaccountably improved, but because positive steps were taken to change the law.

They were there all the time: early morning, noon, and evening. There were little old ladies in gray sweats, young couples in Adidas shoes, middle-aged men with red faces. \"Come on!\" My friend Alex encouraged me to join him as he jogged by my house every evening. \"You'll feel great.\"\u00a0\n Well, I had nothing against feeling great and if Alex could jog every day, anyone could. So I took up jogging\u00a0seriously and gave it a good two months of my life, and not a day more. Based on my experience, jogging is\u00a0the most overvalued form of exercise around, and judging from the number of the people who left our\u00a0neighborhood jogging army. I'm not alone in my opinion.\u00a0\n First of all, jogging is very hard on the body. Your legs and feet have a real pounding (\u8ffd\u51fb) ruining down a road for two or three miles. I developed foot, leg, and back problems. Then I read about a nationally famous jogger\u00a0who died of a heart attack while jogging, and I had something else to worry about. Jogging doesn't kill hundreds of people, but if you have any physical weaknesses, jogging will surely bring\u00a0them\u00a0out, as they did with me.\u00a0\n Secondly, I got no enjoyment out of jogging. Putting one foot in front of the other for forty-five minutes\u00a0 isn't my idea of fun. Jogging is also a lonely pastime. Some joggers say, \"I love being out there with just my\u00a0thoughts\" Well, my thoughts began to bore me, and most of them were on how much my legs hurt.\u00a0\n And how could I enjoy something that brought me pain? And that wasn't just the first week: it was\u00a0practically every day for two months. I never got past the pain level, and pain isn't fun. What a cruel way to do it! So many other exercises, including walking, lead to almost the same results painlessly, so why jog?\nI don't jog any more, and I don't think I ever will. I'm walking two miles three times a week at a fast pace,\u00a0and that feels good. I bicycle to work when the weather is good. I'm getting exercise, and I'm enjoying it at the same time. I could never say the same for jogging, and I've found a lot of better ways to stay in shape.\n\u5c0f\u98981:From the first paragraph, we learn that in the writer's neighborhood _____.\n\u5c0f\u98982:What was the writer's attitude towards jogging in the beginning?\n\u5c0f\u98983:Why did the writer give up jogging two months later?\n\u5c0f\u98984:From the writer's experience, we can conclude that _____.\n"},

Whether it could or not, some people are worrying about the possibility that phones, power lines and Wi-Fi could be responsible for a range of illnesses, from rashes to brain tumors. \nSome say there is evidence to support the growing anxieties. David Carpenter, a professor of environmental health sciences at the university at Albany, in New York, thinks there\u2019s a greater than 95 percent chance that power lines can cause childhood leukemia(\u767d\u8840\u75c5). Also there\u2019s a greater than 90 percent chance that cell phones can cause brain tumors. \u201cIt\u2019s apparent now that there\u2019s a real risk, \u201d said Carpenter. \nBut others believe these concerns are unjustified. Dr Martha Linet, the head of radiation epidemiology(\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66) at the US National Cancer Institute, has looked at the same research as Carpenter but has reached a different conclusion. \u201cI don\u2019t support warning labels for cell phones, \u201d said Linet. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the evidence that there\u2019s much danger. \u201d\nStudies so far suggest a weak connection between EMFs(\u7535\u78c1\u573a) and illness\u2014 so weak that it might not exist at all. A multinational investigation of cell phones and brain cancer, in 13 countries outside the US, has been underway for several years. It\u2019s funded in part by the European Union, in part by a cell phone industry group.

As a teenager, Clinton played saxophone in a band. Townshend, who has the more severe hearing loss, was a guitarist for a band called the Who. He is one of the first rock musicians to call the public's attention to the problem of hearing loss from exposure to loud music.\nTemporary\uff08\u6682\u65f6\uff09 hearing loss can happen after only 15 minutes of listening to loud music. One early warning sign is when your ears begin to feel warm while you listen to music at a rock concert or through headphones. One later is that an unusual sound or a ringing is sometimes produced in your head after the concert.\n\"What happens is that the hair cells in the inner ear are damaged, but they're not dead,\" says physician and ear specialist Dr. Sam Levine. According to Dr. Levine, if you avoid further exposure to loud noise, it's possible to \n the cells\uff08\u7ec6\u80de\uff09 somewhat. However, he adds, \"Eventually, over a long period of time, hair cells are permanently damaged.\" And this is no small problem.\n What sound level is dangerous? According to Dr. Levine, regular exposure to noise above 85 decibels (\u5206\u8d1d) is considered dangerous. The chart below offers a comparison of decibel levels to certain sounds. Here's another measurement you can use. If you're at a rock concert and the music is so loud that you have to shout to make yourself heard, you' re at risk for hearing loss. That's when wearing protective devices such as earplugs becomes critical.\nThe facts are pretty frightening. But are rock bands turning down the volume.'? Most aren't. \"Rock music is supposed to be loud,\" says drummer Andrew Sather.\"I wouldn't have it any other way. And neither would the real fans of rock. \"\nContinued exposure to loud music and the failure to wear earplugs can lead to deafness, according to Dr. Levine. He states, \"There's no cure for hearing loss. Your ears are trying to tell you something. That ringing is the scream of your hair cells dying.

Man in white coat, athlete with electrodes attached and so on. And it's not a hard sell because drinking feels right - you're hot and sweating so surely replacing that fluid must be beneficial.\nWell earlier this year sports scientists in Australia did an extraordinary experiment that had never been done before.This group wanted to find out what happened to performance after \n So they took a group of cyclists and exercised them until they lost 3% of their total body weight in sweat.\nThen their performance was assessed after rehydration with either 1) nothing, 2) enough water to bring them back to 2% dehydration or 3) after full rehydration.\nSo far nothing unusual, but the difference between this and almost every other study that's ever been done on hydration was that the cyclists were blind to how much water they got. The fluid was given intravenously without them knowing the volume.\nThis is vital because we all, and especially athletes, have such an intimate(\u5bc6\u5207\u7684)psychological relationship with water consumption.\nRemarkably, there was no performance difference between those that were fully rehydrated and those that got nothing. This study was part of a growing movement to \"drink to thirst\" which hopes to persuade athletes not to over hydrate with the potentially fatal consequence of diluting your sodium level, causing hyponatraemia.\nPerhaps the result shouldn't be so surprising. Humans evolved doing intense exercise in extreme heat and dryness. We are able to tolerate losses in water relatively well whereas even slight over hydration can be far more dangerous.

The people were part of the ten-year research project. They were taught methods meant to improve their memory, thinking and ability to perform everyday tasks.\nMore than 2,800 volunteered for the study called ACTIVE - short for Advanced (Cognitive) Training for Independent and Vital Elderly.

One class trained participants in skills including how to remember word lists. Another group trained in reasoning. A third group received help with speed-of-processing - speed of receiving and understanding information. A fourth group - the control group did not get any training.\nEarlier results had established that the training helped the participants for up to five years. Now, lead study writer George Rebok says, the research showed most of the training remained effective a full ten years later.\nProfessor Rebok and his team found that the people trained in reasoning and speed-of-processing did better on tests than the control group.\n\"We are wondering whether those effects which endured over time would still be there ten years following the training, and in fact, that's exactly what we found.\"\nThe effect on memory, however, seemed not to last as long. Still, the old people in any of the three classes generally reported less difficulty in performing daily activities than the control group. The total training time for the older people was between 10 and 15 hours. \n\u5c0f\u98981:Which statement is true according to the text\uff1f\n\u5c0f\u98982:What can be inferred from the passage\uff1f\n\u5c0f\u98983:What\u2019s the main idea of the fourth paragragh?\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is the best title of the passage\uff1f\n"},

Yet most people who eat fast food know it\u2019s bad for them. So why do they keep eating it?\nThe answer is simple: the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long-term implications for most people. However, once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you, you may just want to stop eating fast food after all.\n1. Fast food makes you fat.\nA 15-year study of over 3,000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance. In others words, fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes. You probably know this already. But here\u2019s something you may not know.\n2. Fast food is addictive.\nThe more you eat fast food, the more you crave it. One study found that fast food is \u201ca potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations.\u201d If you eat fast food once a week or more, you may be addicted to it.\n3. Fast food is affecting your kids.\nAccording to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they\u2019ve seen. Fast food marketers know this, and design ads accordingly. Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non-nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity.\n4. Fast food \u201cburgers\u201d don\u2019t have much burger in them.\nOne study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2.1 to 14.8 percent. So what makes up the rest of it, you ask? Chemical fillers and preservatives, mostly. That\u2019s why we see read horror stories about burgers that don\u2019t go bad.\n5. Even \u201chealthy\u201d fast food isn\u2019t that healthy.\nFast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options. The problem is, their definition of \u201chealthy\u201d is quite lax. One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King, the Garden Fresh Salad Chicken Caesar with TENDERGRILL Chicken and dressing, still has almost 500 calories and 28 grams of fat, and nearly a day\u2019s worth of sodium.\n6. Fast food is inhumane to animals.\nOkay, this one may not be a reason why fast is killing you, but it\u2019s still a compelling reason to stop eating fast food. 9 billion animals were slaughtered in the US alone in 2012 and much of that meat is for your fast food burgers and chicken sandwiches. Large factory farms resemble more of a \u201cbusiness\u201d than a \u201cfarm.\u201d Animals suffer in crowded spaces where they rarely have access to the outdoors or sunlight. They are pumped full of antibiotics to combat disease, which runs rampant in these conditions. Livestock is one of the biggest sources of pollution and environmental negligence, according to the UN.\n7. Fast food sodas are loaded with sugar.\nHigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is the cheap sweetener most fast food restaurants use in their sodas, desserts, and many other products. Princeton University researchers linked HFCS consumption to obesity in an animal study. Rats given HFCS gained more weight and body fat than those given table sugar.\n\u5c0f\u98981:How many factors are mentioned which can account for the reason why fast food is slowly killing you?\n\u5c0f\u98982:According to the text, we know that_____.\n\u5c0f\u98983:What is the purpose of the passage?\n"},

The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much. You don't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy. The following suggestions may be of some help to you.\nDo not miss meals. Before yon leave home for a feast(\u5bb4\u4f1a),have a small, low-fat snack(\u5c0f\u5403). This may help to keep you from getting too excited before delicious foods. Begin with clear soup and fruit or vegetables. A large glass of water before you eat may help you feel full. Use a small plate; a large plate will encourage you to have more than enough.\nBetter not have high-fat foods.

You can turn painful situations around through laughter.

Inspirational speaker Steve Rizzo recalls a TV interview with an injured firefighter a few days after 9.11\uff0eThe man had fallen more than 30 stories in one of the towers and had broken a leg. Everyone was crying, and the reporter asked, \u201cHow is it that you\u2019ve come out of this alive?\u201d He looked at her and without missing a beat, said, \u201cLook, lady, I\u2019m from New York and I\u2019m a firefighter; that\u2019 all you need to know.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone laughed and though the laughter was only a couple of seconds,\u201d says Rizzo. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s all you need to catch your second breath. Laughter gives you that couple of seconds. You\u2019re sending a message to your brain, and the message is: If you can still laugh even a little among the pain, you are going to be OK.\u201d\nOf course, there is a difference between laughing off a serious situation and laughing off the fear that results. The firefighter was doing the latter, states Rizzo, the author of Becoming a Humorous Being, and so should we. \u201cIf there is anything we have learnt from 9.11, it\u2019s how precious life really is,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to send a message that our spirit won\u2019t die.

There have been few studies of overweight and cognitive functioning, possibly because it is generally believed that it is not a primary risk cause for poor cognitive performance. Losing weight, therefore, may help improve these mental functions, according to a new research led by John Gunstad, assistant professor of psychology at Kent State University.\nGrowing evidence suggests that being fat is linked to cognitive deficits (\u7f3a\u9677). So Gunstad and his team guessed that losing weight might improve mental function. For their study, they measured memory and attention in a group of 150 overweight participants, some of whom had some kind of operation for weight loss and some did not. All of the volunteers completed mental skills tests to assess their abilities of memory and attention at the beginning of the study, and again 12 weeks later. To begin with, about 24% of the patients showed damaged learning and 23% showed signs of poor memory when tested. At the end of the study, those who had lost weight after operation improved their scores into the average or above average range for cognitive functions. Scores for the volunteers who didn\u2019t lose weight dropped even further.\nThe study helped Gunstad to find out whether losing weight had any effect on mental function. Now that he\u2019s seen the positive effect that weight loss can have on memory and attention, he says he will next study those who choose to lose weight by the traditional way\u2014eating healthier and getting more active.

In other words, they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to continue jumping for the near 20 minutes in order to achieve a beneficial physical effect. Second, many regard it as somewhat boring and overly repetitive(\u91cd\u590d\u4e4f\u5473\u7684)\u2014not as something fun or enjoyable. \nInstead of doing the usual two-foot bounce(\u8df3)over and over again, players good at rope-jumping often change their pattern every 10 or 20 jumps: a single bounce, a double-bounce, a skip, a knee-up, side swings, as well as a variety of other easy-to-learn free-style rope-jumping. \nNowadays researchers are discovering that jumping rope also prepares the brain for learning. It is an exercise allowing both brain hemispheres(\u534a\u7403)to perform equally to each other. \nIn short, jumping rope can be a life-long activity requiring little equipment, time and space, yet leading to a much healthier life. \n\u5c0f\u98981: One reason that can explain why rope-jumping has not spread widely is that\n. \n\u5c0f\u98982: The first sentence in Paragraph 2 means that\nin rope-jumping. \n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the researchers, jumping rope\n. \n\u5c0f\u98984:What does the writer think of rope-jumping? \n"},

We do not know how and why it began because we do not know the complete history of the island. But we can certainly imagine the reasons for the beginning of the whistle language. There are many deep valleys on the island. A person on one side of valley cannot easily shout to a person on the other side. But he can whistle and be heard from four miles away, and the record is seven miles. The people who live on the island usually have good teeth, and this helps them to whistle well. They must also have good ears so that they can hear other whistlers. \nWe can understand why the whistle language continues. It is very useful on the island, and quite easy to learn. When somebody is hurt or ill, the whistle language takes the place of the telephone. If the sick person is a long way from the town, boys and men pass the news from one to another. A boy guarding cattle on a hillside whistles to a man fishing from his boat. The last one is able to describe the trouble fully and exactly to the doctor in town. People help each other in the same way when a car breaks or a cow is lost. \nThe whistle language is hundreds of years old, and probably it will continue to live for hundreds of years more. Radio and TV often kill the special ways of speaking in the different parts of a country. But on Comera island you are nobody if you cannot whistle.

The first adult starts by saying, \"I\u2019m not giving it to you,\" and the video goes on to state \"every adult filmed said no and reminded the children that smoking is bad.\"\nBefore going away, the kid hands each adult a booklet after being turned down for a light. The booklet says, \"You worry about me, but why not about yourself?\" Each adult looks around for the child as their faces are filled with confusion and discomfort.\nThe video shows that a few of the smokers quickly threw away their cigarettes or put their cigarettes away, showing that this experiment was affective at that moment.\nThe most influential element in the ad isn't the use of children or the responses from the smoking adults.

But it is exactly oneself that one has the least understanding of.\nWhen you are going upwards in life you tend to overestimate yourself. It seems that everything you seek for is within your reach. When you are going downhill you tend to underestimate yourself, mistaking difficulties for your own incompetence.\nTo get a thorough understanding of oneself is to gain a correct view of oneself-aware of both one\u2019s strengths and shortages. You may look forward hopefully to the future but be sure not to expect too much, for ideals can never be fully realized. You may be courageous to meet challenges but it should be clear to you where to direct your efforts. That\u2019s to say so long as you have a perfect knowledge of yourself there won\u2019t be difficulties you can\u2019t overcome.\nTo get a thorough understanding of oneself needs self-appreciation. Whether you think you are a towering tree or a blade of grass, a high mountain or a small stone, you represent a state of nature that has its own value. If you earnestly admire yourself you\u2019ll have a real sense of self-appreciation, which will give you confidence. As soon as you gain full confidence in yourself, you\u2019ll be enabled to fight and overcome any adversity.\nTo get a thorough understanding of oneself also requires doing oneself a favor when it\u2019s needed. In time of sadness, do yourself a favor by sharing it with your friends so as to change a gloomy mood into a cheerful one; in time of tiredness, do yourself a favor by getting a good sleep. As you are aware, what a person physically has is but a human body that\u2019s vulnerable when exposed to the elements. So if you fall ill, it\u2019s up to you to take a good care of yourself.\nIn a word, to get a thorough understanding of oneself is to get a full control of one\u2019s life. Then one will find one\u2019s life full of color and flavor.\n\u5c0f\u98981: What is described in Paragraph 2 is to show that \n.\n\u5c0f\u98982: Remember not to expect too much of yourself when looking forward to the future because \n.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Having a real sense of self-appreciation can enable one \n.\n\u5c0f\u98984:If this passage is divided into three parts, the second part should consist of \n.\n"},

Wherever you look, there are people, people, people. The trains which leave or arrive every few minutes are packed. The streets are so crowded; there is hardly room to move on the pavements. It takes ages for a bus to get to you because the traffic on the roads has almost come to a standstill. Even when a bus does at last arrive, it\u2019s so full, and it can\u2019t take any more passengers. The smallest unexpected event can bring about conditions of complete chaos. The strange thing is not that people stand these conditions, but that they actually choose them in preference to anything else. \nLarge modern cites are too big to control. People living there are forced by their environment to take a wholly unnatural way of life. They lost touch with the land and rhythm of nature. It is possible to live in such an air-conditioned existence in a large city that you can hardly tell the season. A few flowers in a public park may remind you that it is spring or summer. All the simple, good things of life like sunshine and fresh air are hard to find. Even the distinction between days and nights is lost. \nThe funny thing about it all is that you pay dearly to live in a city. The demand for accommodation is so great that it is often impossible for ordinary people to buy a house of their own. The cost of living is also very high. Just about everything you buy is likely to be more expensive than it would be in the country. Besides, the crime rate in most cities is very high. If you think about it, they\u2019re not really fit to live in at all. Can anyone really doubt that the country is what man was born for and where he truly belongs? \n\u5c0f\u98981: According to the writer, \n. \n\u5c0f\u98982: It is unusual that\n. \n\u5c0f\u98983: City people can hardly tell the seasons because\n. \n\u5c0f\u98984:The reason for things to be more expensive in a city than elsewhere is that\n. \n\u5c0f\u98985: What is the passage mainly about? \n"},

Do you like to post photos of yourself in restaurants to show others what an exciting life you have? Or do you like to write about how happily in love you are? Or perhaps you are of the subtle type who constantly complain about jobs but really just want to impress others with your important position.\nAccording to the results of a series of experiments conducted by Harvard University neuroscientists(\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6), the reward areas of our brain\u2014\u2014the same areas that respond to \u201cprimary rewards\u201d such as food \u2014\u2014are activated when we talk about ourselves. We devote between 30 to 40 percent of our conversation time to doing just that. Unfortunately, Bernstein says, some people can't tell the difference between sharing positive information that others might actually want to know and direct bragging. She suggests that bragging involves comparison, whether stated or implied. \n\u201cWe are expected to be perfect all the time. The result is that more and more people are carefully managing their online images\u201d. says Elizabeth Bernstein, a columnist with the Wall Street Journal. \nBut the issue is not limited to the Internet. In a fiercely competitive job market we must sell ourselves on multiple platforms and show that we are better than others. In fact, we have become so accustomed to bragging that we don't even realize we are doing it, says Bernstein. This is harmful to our relationships and puts people off.\nBernstein talked to some experts who said that people brag for all sorts of reasons: to appear worthy of attention; to prove to ourselves we are doing fine and that people who said we would fail are wrong; or simply because we're excited when good things happen to us.\n\u201cFeel sorry for them, because they're doing this unconscious, destructive thing that won't help them in the long run\uff0c\u201d said Professor Simian Valier, a research psychologist at Washington University. \n\u5c0f\u98981:The underlined word \u201csubtle\u201d in Para.2 is closest in meaning to \u201c________\u201d\uff0e\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which of the following is one of the features of braggarts?\n\u5c0f\u98983:What can we infer from the passage?\n"},

I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate the more what I had left.\nLife, I believe, asks a continuous series of adjustments to reality. In spite of the fact the adjustment is never easy, I had my parents and teachers to help. The hardest lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself. If I hadn't been able to do that, I would have collapsed and become a chair rocker on the front porch for the rest of my life. When I say belief in myself I am not talking about simply the kind of self confidence that helps me down an unfamiliar staircase alone. That is part of it. But I mean something bigger than that: an assurance that I am, despite imperfections, a real, positive person; that there is a special place where I can make myself fit.\nIt took me years to discover and strengthen this assurance. It had to start with the most elementary things. Once a man gave me an indoor baseball. I thought he was laughing at me and I was hurt. \u201cI can't use this.\u201d I said. \u201cTake it with you\uff0c\u201d he urged me, \u201cand roll it around.\u201d The words stuck in my head. \u201cRoll it around\uff01\u201d By rolling the ball I could hear where it went. This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible: playing baseball. \nAll my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them, one at a time. I had to learn my limitations. It was no good to try for something that I knew at the start was wildly out of reach because that only invited the bitterness of failure. I would fail sometimes anyway but on the average I made progress.\n\u5c0f\u98981:We can learn from the beginning of the passage that ________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:What's the most difficult thing for the author?\n\u5c0f\u98983:For the author, the baseball and encouragement offered by the man ________.\n\u5c0f\u98984:According to the passage, the author ________.\n"},

Humor has been evaluated by many great minds such as Thomas Hobbes, who, in \u201cOn Nature\u201d, disliked humor, \u201cLaughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden thought of feeling far better than others.\u201d He thought humor to be a negative quality of human narrow-mindedness. \nHowever, Mordechai Gordon, Ph. D of Education, insists, \u201cHumor allows us to view the world from an angle that is amusing rather than serious.\u201d I agree with Gordon. Learning to look at the world through humor is important. \nIn the United States, every four years an election occurs. Without humor as a way to express their feelings, how else would Americans keep from clawing their eyes out and going the way of lemming? Television shows like \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d have become important parts of American culture. They are mothering the masses by metaphorically(\u9690\u55bb\u5730) airplane-ing politics into our mouths. They make politics fun. \nOf course, politics is only one type of humor. Social humor helps people through the twists and turns of the human condition. American pop culture promotes an unhealthy self- image. On the topic of self-image, Hari Kondabolu stands out. He has a joke about the popular musical group \u201cThe Pussycat Dolls\u201d, describing their hit song \u201cDon't Cha\u201d as a negative representation of women. He points out an obvious offence in American culture. \nA study from Loyola University of Maryland has shown that humor is one determining factor for selecting a mating partner. Amongst other things, mates look for an outstanding funny bone in a potential partner. \nOf course, humor is not always used for good purposes. Humor can be linked to vulgarity (\u7c97\u4fd7)and racism, but, like everything else, it has potential to unite human beings by allowing us to laugh at ourselves, our failures and our connection with one another. \nThough 1ife may seem tough and depressing at times, all I have to do is look in the mirror at my increased wrinkles(\u76b1\u7eb9) to know that there is a comedy out there that even Chaplin wasn\u2019t aware of. \nWith that in mind, remember to laugh with humanity and sometimes at humanity. \n\u5c0f\u98981:Hobbes believes that humor__________. \n\u5c0f\u98982:The fourth paragraph is developed mainly__________. \n\u5c0f\u98983:What can we learn from the last two paragraphs?\n"},

The smaller dolphin, Grace, shows off a few of her tricks, turning around and waving hello to the crowd. The most amazing thing about her, however, is that she's even swimming at all. She doesn't have a tail.\nGrace lost her tail as a baby when she got caught up in a fish trap. When the dolphin arrived at the Ocean Park in December 2005, she was fighting for her life. \u201c Is she going to make it\uff1f\u201d Her trainer, Abbey Stone, feared the worst. Grace did make it\u2014but her tail didn't. She ended up losing her flukes and the lower part of her peduncle.\nOver the past six years, she has learned to swim without her tail. Dolphins swim by moving their flukes and peduncle up and down. Grace taught herself to move another way\u2014like a fish! She pushes herself forward through the water by moving her peduncle from side to side.\nThe movements put harmful pressure on Grace's backbone. So a company offered to create a man\u00admade tail for her. The tail had to be strong enough to stay on Grace as she swam but soft enough that it wouldn't hurt her.\nThe first time Grace wore the artificial tail, she soon shook it off and let it sink to the bottom of the pool. Now, she is still learning to use the tail. Some days she wears it for an hour at a time, others not at all. \u201cThe new tail isn't necessary for her to feel comfortable\uff0c\u201d says Stone, \u201cbut it helps to keep that range of motion (\u52a8\u4f5c) and build muscles (\u808c\u8089)\uff0e\u201d\nNow, the dolphin is about to get an even happier ending. This month, Grace will star in Dolphin Tale, a film that focuses on her rescue and recovery. Her progress has inspired more than just a new movie. Many people travel from near and far to meet her. Seeing Grace swim with her man\u00admade tail gives people so much courage.\n\u5c0f\u98981:When Grace first arrived at the Ocean Park, her trainer worried about her ________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:A man\u00admade tail is created for Grace to ________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:The story of Grace inspires people to ________.\n"},

Economics deals with this problem through the concept of opportunity cost, which simply refers to whether someone\u2019s time or money could be better spent on something else.\nEvery hour of our time has a value. For every hour we work at one job we could quite easily be doing another, or be sleeping or watching a film. Each of these options has a different opportunity cost\u2014namely, what they cost us in missed opportunities.\nSay you intend to watch a football match but the tickets are expensive and it will take you a couple of hours to get to and from the stadium.

This\u2014the alternative use of your cash and time\u2014is the opportunity cost.\nFor economists, every decision is made by knowledge of what one must forgo\u2014in terms of money and enjoyment\u2014in order to take it up. By knowing precisely what you are receiving and what you are missing out on, you ought to be able to make better-informed, more reasonable decisions. Consider that most famous economic rule of all: there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Even if someone offers to take you out to lunch for free, the time you will spend in the restaurant still costs you something in terms of forgone opportunities.\nSome people find the idea of opportunity cost extremely discouraging: imagine spending your entire life calculating whether your time would be better spent elsewhere doing something more profitable or enjoyable. Yet, in a sense it\u2019s human nature to do precisely that\u2014we assess the advantages and disadvantages of decisions all the time.\nIn the business world, a popular phrase is \u201cvalue for money.\u201d People want their cash to go as far as possible.

Even as a child, Muir loved watching nature. As a young man, he spent much of his life exploring the beauty of the wilderness. He walked more than a thousand miles across the country, through fields and woods. John Muir liked writing about the places he visited, describing their beauty.\nMuir also wrote about problems. In order to create more farmland for sheep and cattle, many trees were being cut down. This made Muir unhappy and worried, because he knew that trees were important to forests and to the animals that lived in them\uff0eMuir believed that nature should be conserved(\u4fdd\u62a4)instead of being changed by human beings. He wrote articles in magazines and newspapers to spread the word about conserving forests. Soon, others began to listen.\nMuir wrote letters to important people, such as President Theodore Roosevelt. The president admired Muir\u2019s love for nature. When Roosevelt came to visit Muir in California. Muir convinced(\u8bf4\u670d)the president to go camping with him for three nights under the trees so they could talk about conservation. Later, President Roosevelt set aside 148 million acres of land for national forests and established(\u5efa\u7acb)five national parks. National parks are large areas of land that are protected from development. This means that people cannot build homes or businesses there. One of these parks is Yosemite National Park, the area that is featured on the back of the California quarter.\nThough it has been almost one hundred years since John Muir died, people continue his work today. His work as a conservationist helped us to see the beauty of our natural world. John Muir made us understand the importance of protecting our earth and our resources---then, now, and for the future.\n\u5c0f\u98981:Why did President Theodore Roosevelt visit John Muir?\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why is John Muir featured on the back of a California state quarter?\n\u5c0f\u98983:What is the writer\u2019s purpose of writing this article?\n"},

He noticed this one day during a delivery and gave me a coin out of his changer.\nOf course, he delivered more than milk. There was cheese and other milk products. If we needed to change our order, my mother would write on a note-\u201cPlease add a bottle of buttermilk next delivery\u201d-and put it in the box along with the empty bottles. And then, the buttermilk would magically appear.\nAll of this was about more than convenience(\u65b9\u4fbf). There was a close relationship between families and their milkmen. Mr. Basille even had a key to our house, for those times when it was so cold outside that we put the box indoors, so that the milk wouldn\u2019t freeze. And I remember Mr. Basille from time to time taking a break at our kitchen table, having a cup of tea and telling stories about his delivery.\nThere is sadly no home milk delivery today. Big companies allowed the production of cheaper milk, as a result, making it difficult for milkmen to compete. Besides, milk is for sale everywhere, and it may just not have been practical to have a delivery service.\nRecently, an old milk box in the countryside I saw brought back my childhood memories. I took it home and planted it on the back porch (\u95e8\u5eca).

That number is part of the system used by libraries to organize their collections of books. And it\u2019s used in many countries. The number on each book tells you exactly what kind of book it is. This system is also useful for knowing where to go in the library to find a book.\nIn this system, there are ten large groups of books. Each of these groups has its own number, such as 100, 200, etc. So, for example, any books about language will have a number 400. On the other hand, any books about history will have a number 900. So, a number in the hundreds place tells you what general group a book is in. If you find a book that has a number in the 500s, you know it is a book about science.\nHowever, science is a big group, so the tens place is used to make a more detailed set of science books. For example, math books are included in the group of science books. Math books all have numbers between 510 and 519. Books about the history of Africa have numbers between 960 and 969.\nThe system uses the ones place to give a more exact limit for the subject of a book. A book on the history of South Africa will have the number 968.\nAs you can see, it is a simple system to use as long as you understand what the numbers mean.

In that way, we become stronger and braver.\nOur human nature should be to take risks, but some people just sit and wish they didn\u2019t have the fear to move on.

By taking risks they fought off enemies and discovered new territories\uff08\u9886\u571f\uff09. This attitude has become a part of our modern culture. Riding a roller coaster is a common risk taking activity. Even each person seems to enjoy the risk although they have the understanding that it is dangerous.

Getting out of bed is a risk, too. We need to take risks so that we can complete many things. Astronauts take risks when they get inside a rocket(\u706b\u7bad); however, the things they achieve are great. Businessmen take a risk when they buy parts of a company. However, without doing that, they could not make more money. \nWe need to take risks so that we can gain(\u83b7\u5f97) something. It is impossible to move forward in life, earn money, enjoy a relationship, play a sport, or do anything else without taking a risk. It is all part of the game.

Fewer drivers are drinking alcohol nowadays, since many know about the campaign.\nWang Lankun, a traffic policeman in Beijing said, \u201cSome drivers think a glass of beer is not a problem. But a blood test will show that their blood-alcohol level is more than 20mg for each 100ml of blood, that is enough to affect their driving.\u201d\nDuring the campaign, drivers who have a blood-alcohol level of over 20mg for each 100ml of blood will get a fine of 500 yuan. Also, they will not be allowed to drive for three months.\nIn fact, there are strict laws to punish drunk driving in many other countries. For example, in the USA, if someone has a blood-alcohol level of over 80mg for each 100ml of blood, he will be sent to prison for one year. But in Britain, he will be fined 5,000 pounds and banned \uff08\u7981\u6b62\uff09from driving for 12 months, also he will be sent to prison for 6 months. In Germany, if a driver has a blood-alcohol level of over 60mg for each 100ml of blood, he won\u2019t be allowed to drive until he passes a new driving test.\n\u5c0f\u98981:How long did the campaign last?\n\u5c0f\u98982:The police officers watched many places except ___________.\n\u5c0f\u98983:If a driver drinks a glass of beer before driving in China,_________\n\u5c0f\u98984:If a driver has a blood-alcohol level of over 80mg for each 100ml of blood in Germany,\nwhich punishment will he accept?\n\u5c0f\u98985:From the text, we know_________.\n"},

These new rules are stricter than the old ones.\nUnder the new rules, local governments must make sure that students go to nearby school or \n schools to reduce traffic risks . Also, local governments must help kids in the countryside reach their school buses.\nFrom now on, school buses have a speed limit of 80 km/h on highways and 60 km/h on normal roads. While on the road, other cars must let school buses go first.\nThe new rules also say that school buses must never be overloaded (\u8d85\u8f7d\u7684).\nThere are many other rules as well. A school bus must have more than seven seats. On each bus, there must be at least one adult to keep an eye on the kids. Each school bus must have a fire extinguisher (\u706d\u706b\u5668), a first aid kit (\u6025\u6551\u7bb1) and a GPS.\nA series of school bus accidents happened in China in 2011.

E-cycling centers could recycle the parts that can be reused and deal with the rest properly.\nAnother way is to make producers responsible(\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb) for their used products.

Ben knows that this day \nhonors an important man, but Ben does not feel connected to him. However, the small-world theory (\u7406\u8bba)\n connects Ben to Dr. King. Ben's mom (0) has a close friend, Amy (1). Amy's uncle, Mark (2), once met and\n spoke to John Carter (3), the son of President Jimmy Carter (4). Jimmy Carter knew Dr. King (5). In a way,\n Ben is only \"five people a-way\" from Martin Luther King Jr. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The small-world theory says that everyone in the world is connected through a short chain (\u94fe\u6761) of \npeople they know. Another name of this chain is degrees of separation. Each degree is a step that separates\n a person from someone he or she does not know. There are zero degrees of separation between a person\n and the people he or she knows directly. This means that there are zero degrees between Ben and his mom. \nThere is one degree of separation when just one person separates someone from a person he or she does not \nknow. Ben knows his mom, but he hasn't met her close friend Amy. Therefore, Ben is one degree away from \nAmy. As the chain continues. Amy's uncle, Mark, is two degrees. John Carter is three degrees, and his father\n is four degrees. Dr. King is five degrees away from Ben. The theory says that there are no more than six\n degrees of separation between any two people in the world. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The small-world theory has a lot to do with math. The theory assumes (\u5047\u5b9a) that each per-son knows \n100 people. Each one of those 100 people knows 50 different people. Each of those 50 people knows another\n 50 people, and so on. When someone continues the calculation' to six degrees, it is like this: 100 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 \n50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 50 = 31.25 \u00d7 109. This number is greater than 31 billion (a billion=a thousand million). There are\n over 6 billion people in the world. These numbers show it is possible that six degrees of separation could \ninclude everyone in the world. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Does the small-world theory work? No one has ever proved it.

Hockey Canada has followed the lead of USA Hockey in preventing bodychecking (\u8eab\u4f53\u62e6\u622a) below age 13. A bad head injury of Sidney Crosby, the hockey's greatest star, opened the eyes of hockey people everywhere. This country's children have been facing similar danger at early ages, and Hockey Canada had to deal with a deep worry in the minds of Canadians to make the rule change. The liking for bodychecking from an early age is part of what makes Canadian hockey what it is.\n The change in rules should be taken as a chance to draw special attention to skill development in an environment free of danger.\u00a0 It may also control the loss of thousands of young players who don't enjoy that environment.\n For years, many Canadian hockey parents and coaches have insisted that bodychecking at early ages is necessary to ensure that players can do it safely at older ages. True or not, there may be a safer way to teach hitting than to make younger players pay a price for it in head injuries. When USA Hockey changed its rules for the 2011-2012 season, it also created bodychecking-education programs that will be mandatory(\u5f3a\u5236\u7684) for all coaches,\u00a0 including those teaching players in\u00a0 the pre-checking ages. And it began to encourage more \"touch\" - without real bodychecking - from 9 t0 12. It also made the rules for 13 and up stricter. The USA is trying to show that it's possible to teach hockey protective skills without putting11 and 12-year-olds in greater danger. It's worth the try.\n Hockey Canada has taken serious steps to do away with hits on the head. However, it's hard to change a sports culture so connected with who we are as a country. Too often, bodychecking has been used to try to separate a player from his head rather than from the ball. Children were paying a price for this country's love of the game.\n There are always changes in Canada's game, and the change in the bodychecking age sends the clearest message yet to coaches and parents that player safety is paramount(\u81f3\u4e0a\u7684) in the game.\n\u5c0f\u98981:We can tell that the problem of bodychecking in Canada____________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does the writer want to tell us in Paragraph 2?\n\u5c0f\u98983:What can we learn from the passage?\nA.

It is a way to show people how important and\nuseful the wetlands are for people. On World Wetlands Day, people around the world take\npart in many wetlands activities. People take trips to the local wetlands. There are talks\nabout how important the wetlands are. People get together to clean up their local wetlands\nChildren draw pictures to advertise the day. People also compete(\u6bd4\u8d5b)in boat races.\n The World Wetlands Day is important! If there are no wetlands, there will be no water for anyone in the future. Wetlands help protect nature and resources(\u8d44\u6e90)like fresh water. Already,\u00a0 more than 10000 million people in the world do not have fresh water.\n Many people do not know how important the wetlands are.

At that time, they decided to stop speaking Spanish at home and only communicate in English. This was because they were now living in an English-speaking country.\n Now the Vieira children are adults, and they sometimes travel to Spain to visit their family and friends. But they cannot communicate with them. Unfortunately this is common. When people move to new countries, they often leave their own customs and mother language behind. This is a mistake because there are many benefits to knowing more than one language.\n One advantage of speaking more than one language is that you can communicate directly with more people around the world. You do not have to depend on others to talk for you, so you\u2019re more independent. People who know only one language must use others to help them communicate.\n Furthermore, speaking a second language also allows people to experience other cultures and customs more effectively. Local expressions, vocabulary, and even jokes can have a powerful effect on a person\u2019s understanding of another culture. So, knowing more than one language increases your knowledge of other cultures.\n Finally, having more \n improves relationships between countries. If people from different countries can communicate well, the world can become closer. Countries will then have more respect for each other and better understand each other\u2019s problems.\n The benefits of knowing more than one language are clear. In fact, there are no disadvantages. It is very sad that many people don\u2019t try to learn another language.

Iceland is a country, one-tenth of which is covered with ice. However, it is said that Iceland is the land of heat. Smoking volcanoes (\u706b\u5c71), white steam (\u84b8\u6c7d) and hot springs are more amazing than the other sights including ice there.\n It has taken millions of years for volcanoes and lava flows (\u7194\u5ca9\u6d41) to build Iceland. When hiking through one of Iceland\u2019s many ancient lava fields, you may notice something strange. White steam is rising from each \n in front of you. Iceland is covered with vents which steam can pass out of. The steam comes from naturally heated rocks and hot water below the Earth\u2019s surface (\u8868\u9762).\n Like steam vents, hot springs can be seen here and there in the ancient lava fields. Blue Lake is the most famous hot spring in Iceland. It isn\u2019t far from the capital city of the country. The water and white earth in it can make your skin as soft as a newborn baby\u2019s skin. Enjoy that water, because it has traveled a long way. It starts nearly two kilometers under Blue Lake. There, water from the ocean continues moving up slowly into the spaces between hot rocks below the surface. And then the water is heated by hot rocks. Powerful machines and long pipes (\u6c34\u7ba1) help bring the heated water to the surface. People in Iceland use natural hot water for hot springs. Besides, they use it to create electricity that can be used to heat homes and even greenhouses.\n Iceland is one of the few places on the Earth where active volcanoes lie below ice. Heat from the volcanoes creates a strange and wild beauty. Therefore, some people believe that it\u2019s better to call the country \u201cHeatland\u201d instead of Iceland.

And now! you can google it and find the answer immediately!\nGoogle is the most popular Internet search engine in the world. It was invented by two students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They met in 1993, when they were studying computer science at Stanford University, USA. They dreamed of producing something that could also answer any question in seconds.\nInternet search engines at that time were slow and gave many websites that weren't useful. In January 1996, Page and Brin decided to make a better and faster search engine. They thought the results should be based on the most popular websites.\nNobody would give them money for their project, so they used their own money. They also borrowed money from family and friends. Then, in 1998, they were given a \n for $100,000, and they started their own company. Their first office was in a friend's garage. The company's name is Google, a word which comes from mathematics. A \u201cgoogle\u201d is a very high number---- 1 followed by a hundred zeros.\nThe google search engine was soon used by thousands of people worldwide because it was fast, easy and correct. By 2002 it was the biggest search engine on the Internet. Now, more questions have been answered by Google than any other Internet service, from sport to science, and from music to medicine. Google hopes that in the future all the world's information will be put on the Internet, so that everybody can find everything.\n\u5c0f\u98981:The writer began this passage by asking you a question because ___________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:The underline word \u201ccheque\u201d in the fifth paragraph means _____\n__\n\u00a0in Chinese.\n\u5c0f\u98983:From the passage we know that at the beginning of their project,__\n____.\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which statement is NOT true according to the passage?\n"},

Don\u2019t wait for an apology(\u9053\u6b49). \u201cMany times the person who hurt you may never think of apologizing,\u201d says Dr. Luskin. \u201cThey may have wanted to hurt you or they just don\u2019t see things the same way. So if you wait for people to apologize, you could be waiting a very long time.\u201d Keep in mind that forgiveness does not necessarily mean accepting the action of the person who makes you angry. Mentally going over your hurt gives power to the person who brought you pain. Instead, learn to look for the love, beauty and kindness around you. Finally, try to see things from the other person\u2019s perspective(\u89c6\u89d2). You may realize that he or she was acting out of ignorance (\u65e0\u77e5), fear, even love. To achieve the perspective, you may write a letter to yourself from that person\u2019s point of view. \n\u5c0f\u98981:When someone has deeply hurt you, it\u2019s not easy for you to ________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:What will you do first when someone has hurt you?\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the writer, what is the right way to calm down after being hurt?\n\u5c0f\u98984:Dr. Luskin advises us not to wait for an apology after being hurt because ______. \n\u5c0f\u98985:This passage is mainly written to explain _______. \n"},

For the pedestrians (\u884c\u4eba), it\u2019s very important to be careful when they are walking on the road. Therefore, when we walk across the road, we must try to walk along the pavements(\u4eba\u884c\u9053). We must stop and look both ways before crossing the road.

People rap to express how they feel about their lives and problems.\nRapping in class.\nWould you like to rap in class? Well, actually hip pop music is played in more than 10,000 schools in the USA. Why? There is a new school program called \u201cFlocabulary\u201d in which teachers use texts and hip hop CDs to help teach different school subjects. The words of the songs are just what students are studying. This makes learning easy and fun. Students and teachers are excited about the good results it has had on exam marks. Mr. Lee, a teacher in a high school, said, \u201cI\u2019ve used hip hop songs in class, and I have never seen my students so crazy about history! You can\u2019t imagine how well they remember what I teach! We even try to write our own songs.\u201d\nWhose idea was Flocabulary?\nBlake Harrison, a high school student, was the first person to come up with the idea of Flocabulary. The word \u201cFlocabulary\u201d comes from the word \u201cflow\u201d and \u201cvocabulary\u201d. \u201cFlow\u201d is a rap word for \u201cstyle\u201d, or the way a rapper says the words of a song. \u201cVocabulary\u201d means the words you have to learn in a language. How did he get the idea? Well, he realized he could remember the words of a hip hop song very easily. So, why not make lessons into songs? Today together with Alex Rappaport, a song writer, Blake produces hip hop songs for math, science and literature (\u6587\u5b66). They are now used in schools with great success.\n\u5c0f\u98981: Rap music started ______ in the New York City in the 1970s.\n\u5c0f\u98982:From the passage, we can learn \u201cFlocabulary\u201d is a program to ______.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Blake has produced hip hop sings for school subjects EXCEPT ______.\n"},

The Cinque Terre is a very beautiful national park, which connects five beautiful villages. Walking paths connect the villages, follow the coastline and offer hikes through hills. The villages remain unaffected by tourism.\nTuscany\nAnother Italian region, Tuscany is simply attractive. The buildings there are amazing, and the culture is special. From the historical center of Florence to the Cathedral of Pisa, it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Make sure you check out the nature reserves, and enjoy a few bottles of the very famous wine.\nLauterbrunnen\nSince a school trip here, I've always wanted to revisit this city in Switzerland. The city always seems as if it's trapped in time. There are untouched fountains and springs everywhere, and a huge number of waterfalls and valleys. The area is very popular for skiing.\nThe Greek Islands\nThere are plenty of places to visit in Greece. But I love the Greek Islands best. White houses and beautiful churches, beaches and Aegean Sea make this a very popular place to visit. However, there is more to do here than just sunbathe. I cannot wait to go back and check out the caves and culture that make the Greek Islands one of the best places in Europe.\nVenice\nI am a big Italy lover, and Venice is another city that is not to be missed. It has its own share of history, art and attractive buildings. However, the attraction comes from the pedestrian \uff08\u884c\u4eba\uff09 \u2014 only streets and rivers filled with boats.\n\u5c0f\u98981: According to the passage, people who are interested in waterfalls and valleys would most probably go to _______.\n\u5c0f\u98982: From Paragraph 5 we learn that the Greek Islands_______.\n\u5c0f\u98983: What will you probably see when you are visiting Venice?\n"},

But there is one question that has millions of current answers. That question is \"What's your name?\" Everyone gives a different answer, but everyone is correct.\nHave you ever wondered about people's names? Where do they come from? What do they\nmean?\nPeople's first names, or given names, are chosen by their parents. Sometimes the name of a grandparent or other member of the family is used. Some parents choose the name of a well-known person. A boy could be named George Washington Smith; a girl could be named Helen Keller Jones.\nSome people give their children names that mean good things. Clara means \"bright\"; Beatrice means \"one who gives happiness\"; Donald means \"world ruler\"; Leonard means \"as brave as a lion\".\nThe earliest last names, or surnames, were taken from place names. A family with the name Brook or Brooks probably lived near brook (\u0421\u03ea); someone who was called Longstreet probably lived on a long, paved road. The Greenwood family lived in or near a leafy forest.\nOther early surnames came from people's occupations. The most common occupational name is Smith, which means a person who makes things with iron or other metals. In the past, smiths were very important workers in every town and village. Some other occupational names are: Carter - a person who owned or drove a cart\uff08\u624b\u63a8\u8f66\uff09\uff1b Potter -a person who made pots and pans.\nThe ancestors (\u7956\u5148) of the Baker family probably baked bread for their neighbors in their native village. The Carpenter's great-great-great-grandfather probably built houses and furniture.\nSometimes people were known for the color of their hair or skin, or their size, or their special abilities. When there were two men who were named John in the same village, the John with the gray hair probably became John Gray. Or the John was very tall could call himself John\nTallman. John Fish was probably an excellent swimmer and John Lightfoot was probably a fast\nrunner or a good dancer.\nSome family names were made by adding something to the father's name. English-speaking people added -s or -son. The Johnsons are\n of John; the Roberts family's ancestor was Robert. Irish and Scottish people added Mac or Mc or O. Perhaps all of the MacDonnells and the McDonnells and the O'Donnells are descendants of the same Donnell.\n\u5c0f\u98981:Which of the following aspects\uff08\u65b9\u9762\uff09do the surnames in the passage NOT cover?\n\u5c0f\u98982: According to the passage, the ancestors of the Potter family most probably _______.\n\u5c0f\u98983:If an English couple whose ancestors lived near a leafy forest wanted their new-born son to become a world leader, the baby might be named _______.\n\u5c0f\u98984: The underlined word \"descendants\" in the last paragraph means a person's _______.\n"},

In Europe for example, coffee shops are common places for people to meet friends and to talk while they drink coffee. On the other hand, places like this were not as common in North America in the past. Instead, people in North America liked to drink coffee in their homes with friends. The coffee culture in the USA changed when Starbucks coffee shops spread across the country.\nThe first Starbucks coffee shop opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle, Washington, in the USA. It was a small coffee shop that cooked its own coffee beans. The coffee shop\u2019s business did well, and by 1981 there were three Starbucks stores in Seattle.\nThings really began to change for the company in 1981.That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who\nStarbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, which caused his great interest. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did. In 1982, the original Starbucks owners hired Schultz as the company\u2019s head of marketing\uff08\u5e02\u573a\u8425\u9500\uff09.\nIn 1983, Schultz traveled to Italy. The special environment of the espresso (\u6d53\u5496\u5561) bars there caught his eyes. Back in the USA, Schultz created an environment for Starbucks coffee shops that was comfortable and casual, and customers everywhere seemed to like it. Starbucks began opening more stores across the USA. Then the company opened coffee shops in other countries as well. Today, there are more than 16,000 Starbucks coffee shops all over the world.\nHowever, that does not mean Starbucks has not had problems. In fact, many Starbucks stores have closed over the past few years. On the one hand, this is because there were too many coffee shops competing for business in one small area. On the other hand, stores in some countries closed because the coffee culture there did not match with the \u201cfeel the same everywhere\u201d environment offered by Starbucks.\n The underlined word \u201cran\u201d in Paragraph 3 probably means \u201c\n According to the passage, which is the right order for the following sentences?\na. This man helped to make Starbucks a huge coffee company.\nb. He went to Seattle to learn about the company and later worked for it.\nc.

Is there any holiday that isn't celebrated with a special festival food? Here are several traditional Chinese foods:\nEggs hold a special meaning in many cultures, and China is no exception(\u4f8b\u5916). The Chinese believe eggs mean producing something new. After a baby is born, parents may hold a \"red egg and ginger party,\" where they pass out eggs to announce the birth. In some areas of China the number of eggs represents the sex of the child, for example, an even number(1,3,5,---) for a girl, and an odd number(2,4,6---) if a boy has been born.\nNoodles are a symbol of longlife in Chinese culture. They are as much a part of a Chinese birthday celebration as a birthday cake with lit candles is in many countries. Since noodles represent long life, it is considered very unlucky to cut it off.\nAlthough westerners sometimes may be very sorry to see fish lying on a plate, in China a whole fish is a symbol of richness. In fact, at a party it is traditional to serve the whole fish last, pointed toward the valued guest. Fish also has a special meaning because the Chinese word for fish, yu, sounds like the word for richness or plenty, and it is believed that eating fish will help your wishes come true in the year to come.\nA very popular dish during the Dragon Boat Festival is Zongzi. This tasty dish is made of rice dumplings with meat, peanut or other delicious food in bamboo leaves. The tradition of Zongzi is meant to remind us of a great man, Qu Yuan.\nThe 50-minute program tries to bring something new by presenting more cultural elements(\u5143\u7d20),such as eating habits and the quality of eating.\n\u5c0f\u98981:A bite of China is _______________.\n\u5c0f\u98982:How many kinds of traditional food are mentioned in the passage?\n\u5c0f\u98983:A girl has been born in Mr. Li\u2019s home.

After the visitor is welcomed into the house, he is offered a seat and water at the very beginning, for the host (\u4e3b\u4eba) thinks that the visitor must have come from a very long trip and is in need of water. Then the host family greet the visitor by saying \u201cAkwaaba.\u201d More interestingly, if there is a group of visitors, the host will greet the visitors from right to left. And the host shakes only with his right hand, because the left hand is regarded dirty according to the Akuapem people.\nNext, the visitor is asked how his trip was and why he has come. While the conversation is going on, the wife and children, especially girls, are cooking food for the visitor. The visitor can choose the food. After the visitor has finished eating, the host and the visitor continue their conversation.

Interestingly, Rowland Macy, the company founder ( \u521b\u59cb\u4eba ), opened his first shops between 1843 and 1855, but they weren't\u00a0\u00a0 successful. However, Macy learned from his mistakes, and in 1858 he moved to New York. He opened his first New York store on October 18, 1858 and was immediately successful. Macy's is especially famous for its Thanksgiving Day Parade, which marks the beginning of the Christmas season.\nOne of the oldest shops in London is Fortnum & Mason.\nIt was founded by William Fortnum and Hugh Mason in\n1707 in central London. Originally, the shop only sold food, but these days, it sells all kinds of other things including clothes, books and games. It has the \"Gentleman's\u00a0 Department\" on the top floor, a famous tea shop and several restaurants. The business started out small, but in 1761, William Fortnum\u2019s grandson, Charles, went to work for Queen Charlotte. As a result, the royals ( \u7687\u5bb6 )\u00a0 started shopping there and continues to now. In fact, Queen Elizabeth visited Fortnum's last year. Fortnum's is really famous for its hampers, which are baskets of food. There are picnic hampers and Christmas hampers that are full of wines and Christmas food. They are extremely popular, but also expensive and can cost up to \u00a325.000.\n\u6839\u636e\u6750\u6599\u5185\u5bb9\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6807\u53f7\u6d82\u5728\u7b54\u9898\u5361\u76f8\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n\u5c0f\u98981: How old is the store Macy's which was first opened in New York?\n\u5c0f\u98982: What made Rowland Macy's shops successful?\n\u5c0f\u98983:What did Fortnum & Mason use to sell?\n\u5c0f\u98984:.
