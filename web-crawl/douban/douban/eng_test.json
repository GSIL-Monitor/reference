A strong wind blew the fire from the bakery(\u623f)into a small hotel next door. Then it spread quickly into Thames Street.

The fire destroyed many well-known buildings, old St Paul's and the Guildhall among them.\n\n Samuel Pepys, the famous writer, wrote about the fire. People threw their things into the river. Many poor people stayed in their houses until the last moment. Birds fell out of the air because of the heat.\n\n The fire stopped only when the King finally ordered people to destroy hundreds of buildings in the path of the fire. With nothing left to burn, the fire became weak and finally died out.\n\n After the fire, Christopher Wren, the architect(\u5efa\u7b51\u5e08), wanted a city with wider streets and fine new houses of stone.

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were amazing not only because of their beauty, but also because of their location.\n\n In the 7\n\n century BC a king named Nebudchadnezzar II created the gardens as a sign of love for his wife, Amyitis. According to legend, Amyitis, the daughter of the king of the Medes, was homesick. She missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland.\n\n Upon marrying Nebudchadnezzar II, Amyitis moved to the ancient chief city of Babylon. The area was in the Mesopotamian desert, and the climate there was totally different from where she had left. So the new queen was very sad about the flat and the sun-baked desert. To make Amyitis happier and more comfortable the king decided to build her a series of magnificent gardens.\n\n Many think of the gardens as an otherworldly creation that hung in the air somehow. But experts agree that the gardens were actually built on a mountainside, rather than actually \u201changing\u201d.\n\n The hanging Gardens of Babylon are famous. Stories of them spread throughout the ancient world, and ancient writers recorded a large number of descriptions of the gardens, but some wonder whether this paradise of the past ever existed. There are no historical records of it except stories. Whatever may happen, even the idea of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is amazing. They were essentially impossible to create because of the climate, but they were kept in the minds of many as a botanical beauty created in the middle of unattractive desert scenery.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Hanging Gardens of Babylon are considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, aren't they?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What makes the Hanging Gardens of Babylon so amazing and famous?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Why did the king Nebudchadnezzar II create Hanging Gardens of Babylon?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What made the Hanging Gardens of Babylon essentially impossible to create?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:According to the experts, were the Hanging Gardens of Babylon really hanging or built on a mountainside? \n\n\u5c0f\u98986:Did Hanging Gardens of Babylon really exist?

In the eastern part of the US jeans were hardly worn at all. They were connected with farm people and the workers. So the rich wouldn't like to wear them.\u00a0\n\nIt was James Dean and Marlon Brando that made them popular in movies and everyone started to wear them. They were a symbol of the\u00a0\n\n\u00a0of young people during the 1950s and 1960s. So these new trousers were not allowed in American schools and sometimes in theatres and cinemas. As time went on\uff0cjeans became more acceptable. American people in Europe and Japan often wore them when they were not on duty to show that they were Americans. The trousers showed the world a happier way of life, something that people needed, especially after what they had gone through in World War II.\u00a0\n\nJeans had other advantages as well. They didn't need to be washed as often as other trousers and women didn't need to iron them. This became more important as more and more women started working and had less time for housework.\u00a0\n\nToday jeans are an important part of our lives.

In the fifteenth century, a greenhorn was a young cow or ox whose horns had not yet developed. A century or so later, a greenhorn was a soldier who had not yet had any experience in war (\u6218\u4e89). By the eighteenth century, a greenhorn had the meaning it has today--a person who is new in a job.\n\nAbout one hundred years ago, greenhorn was a popular expression in the American west. Old-timers used it to describe a man who had just arrived from one of the big cities in the east. The greenhorn didn't have the skills that he would need to live in the hard, rough country.\n\nSomeone who has the ability to grow plants well is said to have a green thumb. The expression comes from the early nineteen hundreds.\n\nA person with a green thumb seems to have a magic touch that makes plants grow quickly and well. You might say that the woman next door has a green thumb if her garden continues to grow long after your plants have died.\n\nThe Green Revolution (\u9769\u547d) is the name which was given some years ago to the development of new kinds of rice and other grains.

Honouring a 62-year-old tradition, the President pardoned(\u8d66\u514d)the bird on Thanksgiving eve.\n\nThe tradition of a turkey pardon at Thanksgiving began with President Truman in 1947. Courage comes from Ellsworth, Iowa. The name Courage was chosen by voters (\u6295\u7968\u4eba)who took part in a survey posted on the White House website. The lucky turkey walked on the lawn of the Rose Garden and posed for the cameras at the presidential podium(\u8bb2\u53f0).\n\nThe dinner that has become known as the First Thanksgiving was actually a harvest festival celebrated in December of 1621. That's when English settlers in Plymouth, Massachusetts, gave thanks for the progress they had made after a hard winter in their new country. As America grew, Thanksgiving customs also spread and got bigger. George Washington declared that the first national Thanksgiving would be on November 26, 1789. In the decades to follow, however, people celebrated Thanksgiving locally, with no official date. President Abraham Lincoln declared the last Thursday in November 1863 a national day of Thanksgiving. It stayed that way until 1939, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved it one week earlier. He wanted to lengthen the shopping period before Christmas to encourage gift-buyers and to help businesses. So Congress\uff08\u8bae\u4f1a\uff09 ruled that, after 1941, Thanksgiving would be an official federal holiday falling on the fourth Thursday of November.\n\nThis year we celebrated Thanksgiving on Thursday, November. Millions of Americans got together to give thanks with friends and family. The lucky turkey, Courage, was one of them.

At the age of four, I started speech lessons because even I could not speak well enough to be understood.\n\nFirst grade was a struggle. I not only had difficulty speaking, but I was expected to learn to read and I just couldn't do it. My parents grew more and more frustrated. They bought books and offered great rewards if I could read one of them from start to finish to them. Well, with my speech problems and now my reading problems, I did not like to do reading and so refused to do it whenever possible.\n\nSecond grade was not much better. It was in the second grade that the teacher decided that I needed special education. I remember the days of taking the physical exams. However, after all that, they decided that I did not qualify for special education.\n\nIt was in third grade that a new school was built close to where I lived. I remember going there with my parents and helping to get the school ready so that we could transfer(\u8f6c\u5b66). It was a happy day that we started school at Vandalia. However, things did not get better as my parent expected.\n\nIt was now time for fifth grade. Mrs. Wakefield was my teacher, and if ever there was a teacher that deserved a gold star, it was her. She did not make me feel upset. Instead, she helped me in so many ways and built my self-confidence so that I actually did believe that I could do something special. And that is just what I did.\n\nFor the past 22 years, I have been a fifth grade teacher. Because of Mrs. Wakefield's influence in my life, I am now encouraging students who have had difficulties in their lives to believe that they can overcome and become someone. I have won a large number of awards but I know that all of them belong to one fifth grade teacher who believed in me and challenged me to be all that I could be.\n\nI still have a class picture of her with her fifth grade class hanging on the wall of my office, encouraging other teachers to reach out to their students.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: What does the underlined phrase \u201camount to much\u201d mean in Paragraph l?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:From the second paragraph we know that\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What can we infer from the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:In which grade did the turning point in writer's life appear?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:.What can we learn from the passage?\n\n", "grade": "\u521d\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c1/201408/zdgcc103321076.html"},

Someone who is born today can expect to live 25 years longer than someone who was born in the 19th century.

Here are five rules for a healthy life.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:\n\nWe all know that we shouldn't run across the road in front of the oncoming traffic, or cycle too close to cars. But we're not sure about how to stay safe in the countryside. When you're out walking you should always go with someone. and tell your parents where you're planning to go. Remember! Climbing may also mean falling-what goes up must come down. Safety rules and advice are there to help you, not to make life less fun.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:\n\nSure, it's comfortable to sit on the couch and watch. But experts say you should walk at least 10,000 steps every day to keep fit. In the past, People's jobs required more physical effort. When farmers were working in the fields, they were keeping fit at the same time. Think about it: do you get the same amount of exercise today as they did in the past?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:\n\nIt's important to eat plenty of the right things, above all, fruit, vegetables, and to see fast food or sweets as something very special- maybe just and then. The wrong diet means you'll put on weight, one of the fastest ways to an unhealthy life.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:\n\nWhen we were babies, we slept for much of the day- if our parents were lucky! Teenagers don't need as much sleep but it's important to get about eight hours' sleep. At weekends, you've got more time, so use it not just for your friends, but for rest, too.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:\n\nYes, you knew I was going to say this! But\u00a0it's so important. More teenagers damage their health through smoking and taking drugs than any other dangers. Think about the effect on your family and friends, and think about its effect on you and your health.\n\nE.

Today it seems that one of the best ways to protect your savings, and even increase your wealth is to buy beautiful objects from the past. Here I am going to offer some advice on collecting antique clocks, which I personally consider are among the most interesting of antiques.\n\nI sometimes wonder what a being from another planet might report back about our way of life. \"The planet Earth is ruled by a mysterious creature that sits or stands in a room and makes a strange ticking sound. It has a face with twelve black marks and two hands. Men can do nothing without its permission, and it fastens its young round people's wrists so that everywhere men go they are still under its control. This creature is the real master of Earth and men are its slaves\uff08\u5974\u96b6\uff09.\"\n\nWhether or not we are slaves of time today depends on our culture and personality, but it is believed that many years ago kings kept special slaves to tell the time. Certain men were very clever at measuring\uff08\u91cf\uff09 the time of clay according to the beating of their own hearts. They were made to stand in a fixed place and every hour or so would shout tire time. So it seems that the first clocks were human beings.\n\nHowever, men quickly found more convenient and reliable\uff08\u53ef\u9760\u7684\uff09 ways of telling the time. They learned to use the shadows cast by the sun. They marked the hours on candles, used sand in hour- glasses, and invented water-clocks. Indeed, any serious student of antique should spend as much time as possible visiting palaces, stately homes and museums to see some of the finest examples of clocks from the past.\n\nAntique clocks could be very expensive, but one of the joys of collecting clocks is that it is still possible to find quite cheap ones for your own home. After all, if you are going to be ruled by time, why not invest in air antique clock and perhaps make a future profit\uff08\u6536\u76ca\uff09?\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to the passage, collecting antique clocks\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:By quoting (\u5f15\u7528) the remark of a being from another planet, the author intends to\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following is NOT mentioned as a way to measure the time?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The underlined phrase stately homes in paragraph\uff08\u6bb5\u843d\uff094 means\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The purpose of the passage is\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u521d\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/7scrc303321321.html"},

So I went on the net, spent 15 minutes reading product reviews on good websites, wrote down the names of three top recommendations (\u63a8\u8350) and headed for my nearest big camera store. There in the cupboard was one of the cameras on my list. And it was on special offer. Oh joy. I pointed at it and asked a salesgirl, \u201cCan I have one of those?\u201d \u201cDo you want to try it first?\" she said. It didn't quite sound like a question. \u201cDo I need to?\u201d I replied. \u201cThere's nothing wrong with it?\u201d \u201cNo, no. But you should try it,\u201d she said encouragingly. \u201cCompare it with the others.\u201d\n\nI looked across at the others: shelves of similar cameras placed along the wall, offering different prices. With so many models to choose from, it seemed that I would have to spend hours weighing X against Y, always trying to consider Z and possibly H at the same time. But when I had finished, I would still have only the same two certainties that I had entered the store with: first, soon after I carried my new camera out of the shop, \n\n; and second, my wonderful camera would very quickly be replaced by a new model.\n\nBut something in the human soul whispers that you can beat these traps (\u9677\u9631) by making the right choice. In the end, I agreed to try the model I had chosen. The salesgirl seemed a kind girl. So I let her take out my chosen camera from the cupboard, show how it took excellent pictures of my fellow shoppers... and when she started to introduce the special features, I cut in to ask whether I needed to buy a carry-case and a memory card as well.\n\nWhy do we think that new choices still offer us anything new?

Nearly 300 birds were killed during the competition, leaving a crime scene of feathers and blood. This is the only event in Olympic history that involved killing live animals.\n\nKabaddi (1936)\n\nThis sport is popular in South Asia. The object is for one member of a team to enter the other side's half of the field, and score points. The attacker then returns to his half of the field.\n\n12 Hour Bicycle Race (1896)\n\nSeven riders got on their bikes at 5 a.m. and rode until 5 p.m. Four riders dropped out before noon, but the winner, Adolf Schmal of Austria, managed about 180 miles. Only Schmal and one other finished.\n\nTug of War (1900\u20141920)\n\nThis may seem like a basic PE class sport more than an Olympic event, but Tug of War was actually one of the first sports played at the Olympic games in 500 BC.\n\nThere are two teams of eight; the winning team must pull the other team six feet forward.\n\nSwimming Obstacle Race (1900)\n\nThe athletes had to climb over a pole (\u6746\u5b50) and a row of boats, and then swim under another row of boats. All of this was done in the Seine River, so they also had to fight against the water.

Now we know that getting along with other people is something that we can work at. It is possible to act in such a way that other people will like us better. One way is being unselfish, not wanting everything from our friends. Another way is to look for good points, not bad points in other people. It is surprising how successful this treasure hunt can be.\n\nYou do not have to be spineless (\u4f18\u67d4\u5be1\u65ad\u7684) in order to be popular. In fact, you will be liked or loved if you are not afraid to stand up for your rights (\u6b63\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a). But do it politely and pleasantly. Being friendly and polite to your group, to other people and to strangers and especially to those who do not look important or do not interest you is one way to develop a good character.\n\nYou cannot expect to be perfect, and you must learn not to be unhappy when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one is to be blamed if he does not refuse to learn from them. Many young people become discouraged (\u7070\u5fc3\u4e27\u6c14\u7684) when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like\u2014selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults (\u7f3a\u70b9) and have to fight against them.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you. Some day, things may turn out all right when you have to learn to get along the best with the situation, without thinking too much about it.

Pictures of both the dragon and the giant panda are often regarded as the symbols of China. \n\nGiant pandas look different from other bears because they are white with black patches around their eyes, over their ears, and across their bodies. Although they look adorable and move slow, they can be as dangerous as any other bear when they are angry. Pandas mostly eat bamboo, but they may also eat other food like eggs, fish, oranges and bananas. \n\nMany people think that giant pandas have few babies, and that is one of the reasons that there are not many of them left. But scientists say that a female panda may have about five or six cubs during her life. The female panda gives birth to one or two panda cubs, but she is only able to take care of only one of her cubs. As a result, one of her cubs dies soon after birth because of a lack of intense care. \n\nThe giant panda is an endangered species, and there are only about 2,000 giant pandas left in the world.

Take sportsmen as examples and do the same yourself, so you'll know if you're overworking.\n\nCheck your resting heart rate (\u7387). Every day, before you get out of bed, take your pulse (\u8109\u640f). Usually your heart rate will stay within a few beats every minute. But when you're overworked, the rate increases. If your heart rate is up in the morning, get a little more rest or sleep that night.\n\nCheck your emotions. Getting angry easily? If you can't put your finger on a clear reason, there may be something wrong with your emotions. Hoping to change the condition won't help. The only way out is a break.\n\nCheck your weight.

This is the winner's key to success.\n\nWinners are great at solving problems. For example, if you were late because your car broke down, maybe you need to have your car examined more regularly. Or, you might start to carry along with you the useful phone numbers, so you could call for help when in need. For another example, if your colleague (\u540c\u4e8b) causes you problems on the job for being short of responsibility or ability, find ways of dealing with his irresponsibility or inability rather than simply blame the person. Ask to work with a different person, or don't depend on the person.

Most people know that all the other birds do as well. But have you ever thought about other animals that lay eggs? They include bees, snakes and some sea animals. When a mother lays eggs, many more babies can be born at once, or in a few days, because there is very little development inside the parent. Animals that do not lay eggs often have fewer babies. Animals lay many eggs because other animals may eat the babies. However, even though some of their babies are eaten, they will still have some more to continue their family.\n\n Some animals that lay eggs do not take care of their young. Turtles come onto the beach and dig holes. Then they put their eggs in the sand and leave. A turtle mother can lay as many as 150 eggs. When the babies come out of the eggs, they must find their own way to the ocean. They must learn how to live on their own. Many young turtles get eaten by other animals.\n\n Most eggs have an outside shell that keeps the growing animal inside safe. The egg shell\u00a0also keeps the young animal from drying out.

Courage is challenging yourself to do something even though you think it might be hard. For each promise, find out two or three ways to help you keep it. For example, if you think that Being Honest is the hardest promise for you to keep, one of the ways might be \u201cTell people about my promise so that I won't break it\u201d.\n\nPart 3: Confidence\n\nConfidence is believing that you have the skills to do something. Do you have a beautiful singing voice? Are you a good painter? There are all talents that can make you feel good, as well as the people around you.

Many cultures believed that comets were messages sent by gods, and people thought these messages were warning signs for bad behavior. But today science and technology give us a better understanding of comets.\n\nLast week, comet Ison ended its million-year-long journey as it flew straight toward the sun, melting most of the comet. It was hoped that comet Ison would survive this trip around the sun. Because once it got near Earth, it would have produced a great show of lights for us.\n\nIn ancient times, the coming of comet Ison might have scared people. However, now we can track a comet's journey in our solar system. We can also study what they're made of. There is even a project to launch a spacecraft onto a comet to study them further.\n\nAlthough from the sky they look like great giant fireballs, comets are a collection of gas, ice, dust and small rocks. As a comet goes into our solar system, the sun's solar winds blow some of the dust and gas away, giving the comet a tail. The average size of comets is about 10 kilometers in diameter(\u76f4\u5f84). But amazingly, their tails can be 150 kilometers long! Comet Ison's diameter was about 5 kilometers.\n\nToday, people don't fear comets as much as they did before. Western countries have even developed and old tradition. When people see a comet or meteoroid(\u6d41\u661f) shooting across the sky, they call it a shooting star, People who get the chance to see one get to make a wish.

Of course, we spent lots of time arranging the trip, but it was well worth it! Of course I was afraid that something would go wrong and I was especially worried about my visa, but everything went quite well in the end.\n\nThe most difficult part was getting a visa without an invitation. In the Italian consulate (\u9886\u4e8b\u9986), one must hand in some official paper proving that one has a hotel booked for oneself in order to get the visa. Then we had to solve the ticket problem. Airlines often sell cheap tickets and we bought ours far earlier. The next step was to book a hotel. We finally booked a hotel about 30 km away from the centre of Rome and it was the perfect choice for our trip.\n\nEvery day we took a train that carried us to the centre of Rome. Our big house was among the forest. The beautiful views, nice hosts, comfortable living conditions made us happy to no end. Besides this, we were very lucky that our hostess was Russian. She gave us a lot of advice that was of great use. She told us what transport to choose and where the best places to go.\n\nDon't be afraid to arrange your trip by yourself. It's not difficult!

You begin to sneeze and later you may cough. You must have a cold! Wait a moment. Could it just be a common cold or the flu (\u6d41\u611f) that's been going around?\n\nA cold gives you a runny nose and cough. But it's usually easy to deal with. Some take medicine while others drink herbal tea or chicken soup. Usually you feel better after a week.\n\nOn the other hand, the flu can be much more dangerous. It usually gives you fever. Sometimes it can cause death. According to an American magazine, the worst flu killed about 50 million people from 1918 to 1919.\n\nDon't worry. If you get a flu vaccine (\u75ab\u82d7), it can stop you from getting the virus (\u75c5\u6bd2). Flu vaccines work by giving the body a small amount of flu viruses. This causes your body to develop antibodies (\u6297\u4f53). So next time you get the flu, the antibodies should help you.\n\nThe flu virus changes every few years. Therefore, there are so many types of flu, such as H1N1 and H5N1. The antibodies for one type of flu can't help us against all types of flu. That's why we need to get the vaccine every year.\n\nHowever, good health habits may also help stop you developing a cold or flu. Washing your hands often helps stop you from getting viruses. It is also important to get regular exercise and eat healthy food.

Actually, though,\n\nwe know that this is not true. But we still wonder where that strange feeling comes from.\n\nIn fact, this is one of the ways that we're tricked by time, according to the website All That Is Interesting. The website lists several wrong impressions we often have about time. Let's have a look.\n\nFirst of all, emotions affect our time-keeping abilities: Negative emotions, especially anxiety and boredom, make time seem longer because they make us concentrate more on the passage of time. However, when we are enjoying ourselves, we pay more attention to what we are doing and are likely to lose track of\uff08\u5931\u53bb\u5bf9\u2026.\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\uff09 time.\n\nHere is another example. In 2007, a group of scientists carried out a test. In the test, people fell 50 meters into a safety net and were then asked about their experience. Although the experience took shorter than 3 seconds, the people thought it was much longer than it actually was.\n\nThis is because of the way our bodies reply to danger, according to the scientists. Our bodies produce a chemical called adrenaline (\u80be\u4e0a\u817a\u7d20) when we are faced with danger. It allows us to concentrate better so that we can stay alive. As a result, we are able to remember far more details(\u7ec6\u8282)over a short period of time, which makes it seem like time is going more slowly.\n\nAnother situation when we make mistakes about time is when we take afternoon naps\uff08\u5348\u89c9\uff09\uff0e Have you ever had trouble telling what time it is after a long nap? That's because the best amount of time for a nap is 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, you enter a new stage of sleep called slow-wave sleep. If you wake up mid-way in this stage, it will take a while before you can correctly perceive\uff08\u611f\u77e5\uff09 time again.\n\nYes, time can be mysterious and there is no way to control it So, perhaps the best thing to do is to make good use of every minute.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: According to the passage, what possibly makes people feel so long ?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which is NOT the wrong impressions that we often have about time according to the website listing?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, in which situation do we make mistakes about time?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:According to the passage , what will NOT happen when we are faced with danger ?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage ?\n\n", "grade": "\u521d\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u4eba\u751f\u611f\u609f\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/aabkc303320683.html"},

When he was a boy he ran away from home to work on a ship. However, his father soon found him and brought him home. After that he decided that any future travel he did would be in books. In 1847 his father sent Jules to Paris to study to be a lawyer. Even though he was busy writing, Verne passed his exams in 1849 with high marks. \n\n\u3000\u3000When Jules told his father he did not want to be a lawyer, his father was very angry. He stopped sending his son any money, so Jules had to earn a living by his writing. Over the next few years he wrote many stories and plays, which brought him only a little money. Then, in 1856, he met Honorine de Viane, a rich, young widow with two children. The couple married the next year. \n\nAfter his marriage, Verne worked as a businessman in Paris. However, he was not very successful at his job and spent most of his time writing books and doing research for the next one. In 1863 he published his novel \n\n and the following year he published \n\n which made him famous. His books became so popular and earned him so much money that he was able to leave his job and work full time on his writing.\n\nIn his Lifetime, Jules Verne wrote more than 50 books and he became a rich man.

Earthquakes happen along \"fault lines\" in the earth's crust. Earthquakes can be felt over large areas although they usually last less than one minute. Earthquakes cannot be predicted -- although scientists are working on it! \n\nMost of the time, you will notice an earthquake by the gentle shaking of the ground. You may notice hanging plants swaying or objects wobbling on shelves. Sometimes you may hear a low rumbling noise or feel a sharp jolt. A survivor of the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco said the sensation was like riding a bicycle down a long flight of stairs. \n\nThe intensity of an earthquake can be measured. One measurement is called the Richter scale. Earthquakes below 4.0 on the Richter scale usually do not cause damage, and earthquakes below 2.0 usually can't be felt. Earthquakes over 5.0 on the scale can cause damage. A magnitude 6.0 earthquake is considered strong and a magnitude 7.0 is a major earthquake. The Northridge Earthquake, which hit Southern California in 1994, was magnitude 6.7. \n\nEarthquakes are sometimes called temblors, quakes, shakers or seismic activity. The most important thing to remember during an earthquake is to DROP, COVER and HOLD ON. So remember to DROP to the floor and get under something for COVER and HOLD ON during the shaking. \n\n1. Which statement about earthquakes is not correct?\n\nA. Earthquakes are the result of the sudden shock of the earth's surface.\n\nB.

The price paid for not listening can be high: from making a mess of a task to broken relationships. \u201cFrustrated, devalued, and disrespected\u2014that's how people feel when they're \u2018heard' but not \u2018listened to',\u201d says Jennie Grau, president of communications training and coaching firm Taliaferro Grau Associates. Yet focusing attention and understanding\u2014the qualities that make physically hearing different from actually listening\u2014can be hard to develop.\n\nLearn to truly understand others, and you'll improve your personal and professional skill sets alike. Business is all about relationships, and being a better listener helps you establish more positive relationships, says Rockhurst University communications professor Laura Janusik. \n\nThe first step is to limit anything that draws your attention away. Give up multi-tasking, and focus on what the speaker's saying. If the moment simply doesn't allow you to pay full attention, set up an alternative time when you will be able to concentrate. \n\nNext, stop interrupting. Always want to jump in before the other person finishes speaking? Control yourself like this: Press your fingers firmly, count to five, and re-evaluate whether it's time to talk. Be aware of the subjects or words that influence your emotions\u2014both positive and negative\u2014and calm down before responding. \n\nFinally, listen between the lines. If you hear only the words without paying attention to the speaker's tone of voice, facial expression, and body language, you risk missing hidden meanings or important signals. Confirm you've \u201cgotten\u201d the message. Transform what others said into a few words of your own.\n\nAnd when it's your turn to speak, know you've provided a model for how you hope your words will be received. \n\n63.

A new study of twins suggests you can blame those coarse(\u7c97\u7cd9\u7684)wrinkles, brown or pink spots on too much time in the sun, smoking, and being overweight.\n\n Because twins share genes, but may have different exposures to environmental factors studying twins allows an \u201copportunity to control for genetic susceptibility(\u6613\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u6027),\u201d Dr. Elma D. Baron, at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, and his colleagues explain in the latest issue of Archives of Dermatology.\n\n Their analysis of environmental skin-damaging factors in 65 pairs of twins hints that skin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors.\n\n But when it comes to skin cancer, the researchers say their findings support previous reports that both environment and genes affect skin cancer risk.\n\n Baron's team examined facial skin of 130 twins, 18 to 77 years old, who lived mostly in the northem Midwest and Eastern regions of the US, who were attending the Twins Days Festival in Ohio in August 2002. At this time, each of the twins also separately reported how their skin burned or tanned(\u6652\u9ed1)without sunscreen, their weight, and their history of skin cancer, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The study group consisted of 52 fraternal(\u5f02\u5375\u53cc\u751f)and 10 identical twin pairs, plus 3 pairs who were unsure of their twin status.\n\n From these data, the researchers noted strong ties, outside of twin status, between smoking, older age, and being overweight, and having facial skin with evidence of environmental damage. By contrast, sunscreen use and drinking alcohol appeared related to less skin damage.\n\n Baron and his colleagues say the current findings, which highlight ties between facial aging and potentially avoidable environmental factors\u2014such as smoking, being overweight, and unprotected overexposure to the sun's damaging rays\u2014may help motivate people to minimize these risky behaviors.\n\n67\uff0eWhich of the following is true according to the passage?\n\n A\uff0eJeanne and Susan share all the habits including smoking.\n\n B\uff0eSkin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors.\n\n C\uff0eOnly identical twins can take part in the research.\n\n D\uff0eSunscreen use cannot help people have less skin damage.\n\n68\uff0eWhy did Baron's team do the research on twins?\n\n A\uff0eTwins are more likely to suffer from skin cancer.\n\n B\uff0eIt may guarantee the research is not influenced by genetic factors.\n\n C\uff0eIt gives others an opportunity to control twins' genes.\n\n D\uff0eIt helps find twins are exposed to different environments.\n\n69\uff0eWhat can you infer from the last paragraph?\n\n A\uff0eThis research makes people aware of dangerous lifestyles.\n\n B\uff0eThe environmental factors are unavoidable.\n\n C\uff0eBeing exposed to the sun is absolutely damaging.\n\n D\uff0eThere is little relationship between skin aging and environment.\n\n70\uff0eThe passage is mainly concerned with\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n A\uff0eskin cancer and environment\n\n B\uff0eidentical twins research\n\n C\uff0eaging skin and environmental factors\n\n D\uff0egenes and lifestyles\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u504f\u6613,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u4eba\u7269\u4f20\u8bb0\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g0/201408/trqog003347196.html"},

I was in Brian's team, and he obviously had Dickens in mind because he told me to go in goal. No one ever wanted to be the goalkeeper.\n\n\"He's big enough and useless enough;\" Brian said when someone asked him why he had chosen me.\n\nAs the boy kicked the ball hard along the ground to my right, I threw myself down quickly and saved it.

My dad was to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ in New Jersey because of work. My family was splitting apart.\n\nNow that my mom is a \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ parent, I do my own laundry, make dinner and do extra chores around the house. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ it was hard at first, I now recognize the positive \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ that this responsibility had on me. My mother gave me these \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and duties so that I would learn to become self-disciplined (\u81ea\u5f8b\u7684) and trustworthy.\n\nI strive to show these \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ in my life, and have seen the benefits. When I was only 11 years old, my \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ told me that he was selecting me as soccer team captain because of my determination and ability to get my teammates to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ themselves.

Personally, I don't feel the need to drink to have fun, and I stand by my decision even when others try to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ me.\n\nMy mom and dad both found new \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and happily remarried. I am \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ close to my father, even though he lives 4,800 km away. I thought my parents' divorce was going to be the worst thing that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ happened to me.

But, like any king whose throne has been taken away, the Swiss star is already planning secretly his return to power, beginning at this week's US Open.\n\nThe problem is, many experts think he will never do it. They blame everything from age and tough competition to his racket and psychology.\n\nFor years Federer, 27, had enjoyed the view from the top. Competitors saw him as undefeated, and for the most part he was. However, before the 2008 season began, Federer had an illness that stole his strength and clearly affected his play on the court. Ever since, he has struggled to return to form, winning just two of his last 14 tournaments.\n\n\u201cTwenty-seven is an age when \n\n.\u201d tennis great John McEnroe told the New York Times.\n\nPancho Sefura, another tennis great, noted that Federer is also facing a maturing crop of young talents. \u201cThere are too many great players now,\u201d he said, naming Britain's Andy Murray, 21, and Latvia's Ernests Gulbis, 20.\n\nUS magazine Sports Illustrated tennis columnist Jon Wertheim suggested that part of Federer's problem could be his insistence on using a small racket. He says that the smaller head demands ball control. But we see time and again that racket makers try to get players to use a certain stick \u2014 one they would like to market to consumers and it has a negative effect the professional game.\n\nSports psychologist Jim Loehr told the Times that Federer is probably feeling \u201ca sense of doubt\u201d after being considered as undefeated for so long. If Federer is to recover his state of being undefeated, Loehr said he must overcome his doubt. \u201cFederer doesn't need fame and money. But he has to get better. He has to go to a whole new level.

Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. The beginnings of modem dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed.\n\nHer search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea. Her great contributions are in three areas.\n\nFirst, she began the expansion of the kinds of movements that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concerts.\u00a0 In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity (\u6280\u5de7\u9ad8\u8d85) shown by complicated, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using all her body in the freest possible way.\u00a0 Her dance stemmed from (\u6e90\u81ea) her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.\n\nHer second contribution lies in dance costumes (\u670d\u88c5). She discarded corset, ballet shoes, and stiff costumes.\u00a0 These were replaced with flowing clothes, bare feet, and unlimited hair.\u00a0 She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.\n\nHer third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies (\u4ea4\u54cd\u4e50) of great masters, including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom.\n\nShe was as exciting and eccentric in her personal life as in her dance.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:.

Working\n\n in five teams with four women in each team,they walked to the\n\nNorth Pole. Apart from one experienced female guide, the other\n\nwomen were all ordinary people who had never done anything like\n\nthis in their lives before. They managed to survive in an environment \n\nand defeated several very experienced men during the same\n\nperiod.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once on the ice, each woman had to ski along while dragging a\n\nsledge (\u96ea\u6a47) weighing over 50 kilos. The Arctic ice was pushed up\n\ninto huge piles two or three meters high, and the sledges had to be\n\npulled up one side and carefully let down the other all on the rough\n\nsurface so that they didn't become damaged. The temperature was\n\nalways below the freezing point and sometimes strong winds made\n\nwalking while pulling so much weight almost impossible. It was also\n\nvery difficult for them to put up their tents when they stopped each\n\nnight.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In such conditions ,'the women were making good progress if\n\nthey covered fourteen or fifteen kilometers a day. However, part of\n\nthe journey was across a frozen sea with moving water underneath\n\nthe ice and at some points the team would drift(\u6f02\u6d41) back more\n\nthan five kilometers during the night. That meant that after walking\n\nin these very severe conditions for ten hours on one day, they had to\n\nspend part of the next day covering the same ground again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So,how did they manage to succeed? They realized that they\n\nwere part of a team. If any one of them didn't pull her sledge or get\n\nher job done, she would endanger the success of the whole expedition. \n\nAny form of selfishness could result in the efforts of everyone\n\nelse being completely wasted, so personal feelings had to be put to\n\none side. At the end of their journey, the women agreed that it was\n\nmental effort far more than physical fitness that got them to the\n\nNorth Pole.\n\n1.

Every day I put my hand in hers as our eyes met. She never\n\n failed to return my smile, my grasp, and my greeting.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the last day of our visit, I found myself alone on a busy corner across the street from our \n\nhotel. Bicycles and motorbikes rushed in front of me. As I hesitated on the sidewalk, I felt a hand\n\n on my elbow and looked down to see the smile of my small beggar friend looking up at me. She \n\nnodded her head toward the street, indicating that she would take me across. Together, we moved\n\n slowly into the chaos.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then we moved on toward the sidewalk, where she pulled my face down to hers, kissed me on\n\n both cheeks, and then left, still smiling and waving back to me.\n\nTraveling in poorer nations, I have witnessed a variety of ways to deal with beggars. The most \n\ncommon response of tourists faced with the poverty-stricken is to ignore them and focus their eyes \n\nelsewhere. I have seen people push away an outstretched hand in angry annoyance. A few may drop\n\n a few coins into the hand in a hurry, hoping that other ragged pursuers won't immediately appear on\n\n the scene.\n\nFor many reasons, giving money is not the best response to an outstretched hand. Many world\n\n travelers have discovered that the greatest gift they can give is their time and respect. Everyone needs\n\n recognition, to be seen as worthy of being known, to feel appreciated and loved. And I believe that\n\n everyone is worthy and worth knowing.\n\n1.

His name was Mr. Basil. He wore a white cap and drove a white truck. As a 5-year-old boy, I \n\ncouldn't take my eyes off the coin changer fixed to his belt. He noticed this one day during a delivery and\n\ngave me a quarter out of his coin changer. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, he delivered more than milk. There was cheese, eggs and so on. If we needed to change \n\nour order, my mother would pen a note-\"Please add a bottle of buttermilk next delivery\"-and place it in the\n\nbox along with the empty bottles. And then, the buttermilk would magically appear. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All of this was about more than convenience. There existed a close relationship between families and \n\ntheir milkmen. Mr. Basil even had a key to our house, for those times when it was so cold outside that we \n\nput the box indoors, so that the milk wouldn't freeze. And I remember Mr. Basil from time to time taking \n\na break at our kitchen table, having a cup of tea and telling stories about his delivery. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is sadly no home milk delivery today. Big companies allowed the production of cheaper milk, thus\n\nmaking it difficult for milkmen to compete. Besides, milk is for sale everywhere, and it may just not have\n\nbeen practical to have a delivery service. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recently, an old milk box in the countryside I saw brought back my childhood memories. I took it home \n\nand planted it on the back porch (\u95e8\u5eca). Every so often my son's friends will ask what it is. So I start telling \n\nstories of my boyhood, and of the milkman who brought us friendship along with his milk. \n\n1. Mr. Basil gave the boy a quarter out of his coin changer \\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\nA. to show his magical power. \n\nB. to pay for the delivery \n\nC. to satisfy his curiosity. \n\nD. to please his mother. \n\n2. What can be inferred from the fact that the milkman had the key to the boy's house? \n\nA. He wanted to have tea there. \n\nB. He was a respectable person. \n\nC. He was treated as a family member. \n\nD. He was fully trusted by the family. \n\n3. Why does home milk delivery no longer exist? \n\nA. Nobody wants to be a milkman now. \n\nB. It has been driven out of the market. \n\nC. Its service is getting poor. \n\nD. It is forbidden by law. \n\n4. Why did the author bring back home an old milk box? \n\nA. He missed the good old days. \n\nB. He wanted to tell interesting stories. \n\nC. He missed it for his milk bottles. \n\nD. He planted flowers in it. \n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u9ad8\u8003\u771f\u9898      ", "topic": "\u6545\u4e8b\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201108/k71yg303179004.html"},

He must have not had enough money to get \n\nsomething to eat.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then a dog walked up to the front of the building.

She settled into the group easily, and would be \n\nfirst on the slide and highest up the climbing frame. She could put on her coat without help and not only\n\nfasten her own buttons but other children's too. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She was a lovely child but unfortunately a scratcher. If anyone upset her or stood in her way, her right \n\nhand would flash out fast and scratch down the face of her playmates. Children twice her age would fly in\n\nfear from her. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This must have been very rewarding for Kathy but obviously it had to be stopped. All the usual ways \n\nfailed and then I remembered an account by G Atkinson Highfield School, of how fights in the playground \n\nhad been stopped. No punishment had been given, but the attacker had been ignored and the victims rewarded.\n\nSo I decided to try out on Kathy. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With a pocketful of Smarties I followed Kathy around. She was so quick that it was impossible to prevent\n\nher scratching, but I was determined to stay within arm's length all afternoon. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All was peaceful but then I saw Kathy's hand moved and heard the scream. Gently I gathered up the little\n\nhurt one in my arms and said \"Nice, nice sweetie\" and then looked puzzled when she got nothing. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Soon came another scream, this time from John. While holding him in my arms, I said, \"Look, Kathy, a \n\nnice Smartie for John\" and put it into John's mouth. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A smile of understanding flashed across Kathy's face.

She has never scratched a child since. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Parents who find older children \n\n younger brothers and sisters might do well to replace shouting \n\nand punishment by rewarding and giving more attention to the injured ones.

My\u00a0\n\n went out to him. So, I ran over to him. As I handed him his glasses, he looked at me \n\nand said, \"Hey, thanks!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As it turned out, he lived near me. We\n\ntalked all the way home. He turned out to be a pretty\u00a0\n\n kid. Over the next four years, Kyle and I \n\nbecame best friends\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kyle was the top student of our class, one of those guys that really found themselves during high \n\nschool. He had to prepare a speech for\u00a0\n\n. On the graduation day, I could see that he was\u00a0\n\n about \n\nhis speech. So, I patted him on the back and said, \"Hey, big guy, you'll be great!\" He looked at me and\n\nsmiled. At graduation, he cleared his throat, and began. \"Graduation is a time to\n\n those who helped \n\nyou make it through those\u00a0\n\n years. Your parents, your teachers, but mostly your friends. I am here to \n\ntell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give them.

In conversation he expressed little joy and it seemed that his life was \n\ndrawing to a close.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When his heart \n\nproblems led to an operation, Jim went through it successfully, and a full recovery\n\n was expected. Within days, however, his heart was not beating properly. Jim was rushed back to \n\noperation, but nothing was found to explain the cause of his illness. He died on the operating table on\n\n the day before his 48th birthday.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Bruce Smoller, a psychologist, had had many conversations with him, and the more he learned,\n\n the stranger he realized Jim's case was. When Jim was a child, his father, a teacher, suffered a heart \n\nattack and stayed home to recover. One morning Jim asked his father to look over his homework,\n\n promising to come home from school at noon to pick it up. His father agreed, but when Jim returned \n\nhis father had died. Jim's father was 48.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I think all his life Jim believed he killed his father,\" Dr. Smoller says. \"He felt that if he had not \n\nasked him to look at his homework, his father would not have lived. Jim had been troubled by the idea. \n\nThe operation was the trial he had expected for forty years.\" Smoller believes that Jim willed himself not\n\n to live to the age of 48.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jim's case shows the powerful role that attitude plays in physical health, and that childhood \n\nexperiences produce far-reaching effect on the health of grown-ups. Although most cases are less \n\ndirect than Jim's, studies show that childhood events, besides genes, may well cause such midlife\n\n diseases as cancer, heart disease and mental illness.\n\n1.

What made Dr. Smoller feel strange about Jim's case?\n\nA. Jim died at a young age.\n\nB. Jim died on the operating table.\n\nC. Both Jim and his father died of the same disease.\n\nD. Jim's death is closely connected with his father's.\n\n3. From Smoller's words, we can infer that \n\n.\n\nA. Jim's father cared little about his study\n\nB.

I went into the first shop expecting a friendly reception.\u00a0\u00a0I \n\nwas quite wrong.\u00a0\u00a0The man wouldn't even look at my chair.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second shop,\u00a0\u00a0though slightly more polite,\u00a0\u00a0was just the same,\u00a0\u00a0and the third and the fourth- so I \n\ndecided that my approach must be wrong. I entered the fifth shop with a plan in my mind.\u00a0\u00a0I placed the \n\nchair on the floor and said to the shopkeeper,\u00a0\u00a0\"Would you like to buy a chair?\" \"Twenty pounds,\" I \n\nsaid.\u00a0\u00a0\"OK,\"he said. \"l'll give you twenty pounds.\" \"It's got a slightly broken leg,\" I said.\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I saw that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt's nothing.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Everything was going according to the plan and I was getting excited.\u00a0\u00a0\"What will you do with it?\" I\n\nasked.\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, it will be easy to sell once the repair is done. \" \"I'll buy it,\" I said.\u00a0\u00a0\"What do you mean? \n\nYou've just sold it to me,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes,\u00a0\u00a0I know but I've changed my mind.\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry. I'll give you \n\ntwenty-seven pounds for it.\"\u00a0\u00a0\" You must be crazy,\" he said. Then, suddenly the penny dropped.\u00a0\u00a0\"I\n\nknow what you want. You want me to repair your chair.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"You're right,\" I said.\u00a0\u00a0\"And what would you have done if I had walked in and said,\u00a0\u00a0 'Would you\n\nmend this chair for me?'\" \"I wouldn't have agreed to do it,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\"We don't do repairs, not enough \n\nmoney in it and too much trouble.\u00a0\u00a0But l'll mend this for you.\u00a0\u00a0Shall we say for a fiver?\" He was a very \n\nnice man and was greatly amused by the whole thing.\n\n1.

Bedford Castle is one of those structures and, although it is nowhere near its former glory today, it is an essential attraction to visit if you really want to grasp what its heritage means to the county!\n\nBedford Castle was built \n\n as a fortress to help protect Bedfordshire on the south of the River Ouse after the people in the local towns and villages had already been subdued. It was erected in 919 on the orders of King Edward the Elder, although it was destroyed by a Danish invasion years later. This was when it was rebuilt as the castle, of which the ruins exist today!\n\nThere is a long history behind the castle that involves several kings as a result of the Duke of Bedford being an ardent royalist. Bedford Castle repeatedly offered the kings of England refuge against various storms in the form of onslaughts from abroad and various domestic threats against them, and this is where much of its fame lies, even though the castle itself is no longer there. There are various tours of the ruins that you can take when you visit though and all of the guides are extremely knowledgeable. They will happily tell you tales of the mound and the castle that preceded it.\n\nThe mound is open to the public all year round and is a proud part of the area's heritage. It is recommended by the majority of people that visit Bedfordshire because it tells you much about why the county is currently how it is. You can view the river from the mound and the surrounding settlements as well as the remains of the castle, and every moment spent there is worth it so enjoy the history and the very nature of the county itself! \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What do we know from the first paragraph?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: The underlined word \u201cinitially\u201d in Paragraph 2 probably means \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ .\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The kings of England came to Bedford Castle \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Why are visitors recommended to visit Bedfordshire\uff1f\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The purpose of writing the text is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u5e7f\u544a\u5e03\u544a\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/y6c9g303412048.html"},

Alongside it was a\n\n note apologizing again, and the innocence in which she had taken the fabric. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To this day, I still get tears in my eyes when I think of how I reacted and still feel the pain of my \n\nactions.

You'll need it\u2014\u2014the desert gets rather cold at night. During the day, the temperature will be agreeable and comfortable. Any other time, pack as if you're going to Phoenix of Vegas in August. For the ladies, bathing suits are normal if there's a pool where you are going, but leave the string bikini at home \u2013it is a Muslim country, after all. Last, if you are planning on visiting any mosques\uff08\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa\uff09or certain parts of upper Egypt, ladies will need to plan on bringing something that comes at least to the elbow\uff08\u8098\u90e8\uff09, and no shorts for men or women in those areas.\n\nWhat special things do I need to pack?\n\nOne of my favorite things in the world to bring to Egypt is an Evian Mister, a sprayer with a fine mist of Evian water. You may be able to find it in your local drug store. Spray a little on your face or head , and your body temperature will feel like it's dropped 10 or 15 degrees. Other items include your camera, sun block and extra batteries.\n\nHow do I communicate with home?\n\nInternet cafes are plentiful everywhere, especially in Cairo, Luxor, and Alexandria. If you have international calling on you phone, you should be able to use it-AT\uff06T and Sprint both work internationally for sure, but make sure you have the international coverage. A satellite phone is best if you are certain to need coverage in the middle of the country, like while sailing up the Nile , but for most people these days a cell phone is fine.\n\nWhat medical preparation do I need?\n\nIn a word: none! The one thing you may come down with in Egypt is politely called \u201cPharoah 's Revenge. \u201d The thing that gets rid of pharoah's Revenge is a regionally produced medicine, and is available at every drugstore for \uff041 a box .

It's hardly surprising that your feelings of not being \u201cgrown up\u201d have come on strongly at this point in your life, just before you're about to become a father. You are asking: will I make a good father? How will I deal with? Should I have brought another little person into the world? Can I provide for it? Help! I think nearly every sensitive about-to-be-parent must have these occasional feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy\uff08\u4e0d\u9002\uff09before the birth and it would be most unusual if you didn't share them.\n\nIt's difficult, honestly, to feel grown-up unless you have something less grown-up to relate to. The boss with a hen-pecking wife may feel like a seven-year-old when he's at home. But as he walks through the office door, and knows he's going to be surrounded by staff looking to him for advice, he grows into a fully mature\uff08\u6210\u719f\u7684\uff09man. And I think it's a mistake to imagine that we all feel, as we age, a kind of progression of states, from the baby to the adult. Most people feel, on Tuesday, about three years old, and on a Wednesday, around 80. I remember feeling very grown-up at eight, a time when I was weighed down with responsibility. These days, much older, I can, in the company of people I feel at ease with, feel like a young girl.\n\nThere's a common remark that \u201call men are little boys\u201d, but it's not true. It's more true that men often behave like little boys. But nearly all people, at some moments in their lives, are able of great maturity.\n\nOnce your baby arrives, you'll soon feel less childlike, or rather, less often. When your child tries to put its fingers into the electric plug, the adult in you will rise up to prevent it. You'll see you have very little in common with a needy child, particularly if it's looking to you for comfort and support.\n\nComfort yourself, David, with two truths. One is that your friends laugh when they talk about this subject because they, like you, feel frightened. And remember that people who haven't grown up don't go around talking about the fact that they don't feel grown-up.\n\nHope my advice will be helpful and good luck to you and your little one.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nMiss Advice\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to the passage, Miss Advice thinks David's self-doubt \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: From Paragraph 2, we can learn that people's sense of maturity \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Miss Advice holds the view that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u5e7f\u544a\u5e03\u544a\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g1/201408/8ws7g103454843.html"},

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University, US, say that this may someday be possible.\n\nA drug remains far off, but researchers have laid a foundation with their discovery that proteins can be removed from the brain's fear center to cut memories forever.\n\nPrevious research had already shown that a special behavior therapy (\u6cbb\u7597) could cut painful memories. But relapse (\u590d\u53d1) was possible because the memory hadn't necessarily disappeared.\n\nBy looking at that process, Richard Huganir and Roger Clem, two researchers from Johns Hopkins University, discovered a \u201cwindow of vulnerability (\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u7a97\u53e3)\u201d when proteins are created. The proteins help signals travel within the brain as painful memories are made. Because the proteins are unstable, they can be easily removed with drugs or behavior therapy to cut memories.\n\nResearchers used mice to find the window, but think the process would be the same in humans. They used electric shocks to make the mice fear a certain sound. The sound triggered (\u89e6\u53d1) the creation of the proteins, called calcium-permeable (\u9499\u901a\u900f\u6027) AMPARS, which formed for a day or two in the fear centers of the mice's brains.\n\nThe researchers are working on ways to reopen the window by recalling (\u5524\u9192) the painful memory and using drugs to remove the protein. They published their report online last month in Science Express.\n\nTheir research has drawn interest and concern from experts in mental healthcare.\n\nKate Farinholt, a mental health expert with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Maryland, US, said many people suffering from a painful event might benefit from erasing a memory. \u201cErasing a memory and then everything bad built on that is an amazing idea, and I can see all sorts of potential ,\u201d she said.\n\nBut there are a lot of unanswered questions, too.\n\n\u201cCompletely deleting a memory is a little scary.

Compared with foreign festivals, traditional Chinese festivals are not inferior(\u6b21\u4e8e) in cultural meanings, but lack of fashion sought by modern people. If people do not appreciate the historical culture contained by traditional festivals, and only take pleasure-seeking as the most important, the significance of traditional festivals will fade away and the inheritance(\u7ee7\u627f) of fine traditional culture will be cut off. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The second paragraph implies that\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:We can learn from the passage that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Many Chinese youth dislike traditional festivals because they think \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What would be the best title of the passage?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u504f\u6613,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g2/201408/g618g203451235.html"},

It has taken over our culture --- and our smartphones. The rise of the selfie has become universal\u2013between presidents, celebrities(\u540d\u4eba) and citizens alike\u2013and the trend is only continuing to grow. \n\nA recent survey conducted by the Pew Internet \\& American Life Project found that 54 percent of Internet users have posted original photos online. And of those hundreds of millions of photos, many are of selfie photos.\n\nFor example, currently there are nearly 62 million posted selfie photos on Instagram, the social media tool that has significantly contributed to the personal photo's popularity. That figure, which continues to rise every day, doesn't even begin to include the selfies shared on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWhat makes the selfie so attractive -- and why do we feel it a must to take one? According to Dr. Pamela Rutledge, psychologist and director of the Media Psychology Research Center, the desire to take, post and get \u201clikes\u201d on selfies goes back to a biological behavior of all humans.\n\n\u201cI think it influences our sense of social connection in the same way as it does when you go to a party and people say \u2018Oh I love your dress,'\u201d Rutledge told The Huffington Post. \u201cBiological, social recognition is a real need and there is even an area of the brain that contributes to social activity.\u201d\n\nThere is a way to adapt to the growing selfie culture. Whether you're a selfie \n\n or an advanced poster, there are always things to be mindful of when you're posting, Rutledge advises. \n\nShe offered two main principles to follow when it comes to posting on social media:\n\n1. The Grandmother Rule\n\n\u201cDon't post anything online, whether text or visual, that you don't want grandmother or future employer to see,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cSelfies especially.\u201d\n\n2. The Elevator Rule \n\n\u201cYou wouldn't say something in an elevator that you or no one else wants to hear -- the whole world of social media is an elevator,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cBe aware of the breadth (\u5bbd\u5ea6) of platform. It's easy to think you're sharing a photo with a few people, but Instagram is public and people can come across things.\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What's the main idea of the first paragraph?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: According to the passage, people like \u201cselfie\u201d so much, because they \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983: The underlined word \u201cnovice\u201d in Paragraph 6 probably means \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:When it comes to posting on social media, Rutledge advises people to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u504f\u6613,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g2/201408/b46bg203451236.html"},

Now, their mistake has been worsened after further research found it was even older \u2013 at 507 years.\n\nThe ocean quahog, a type of deep-sea clam, was dredged (\u6355\u635e) alive from the bottom of the North Atlantic near Iceland in 2006 by researchers. They then put it in a fridge-freezer, as is normal practice, unaware of its age. It was only when it was taken to a laboratory that scientists from Bangor University studied it and concluded it was 400 years old.\n\nThe discovery made it into the Guinness Book of World Records. However, by this time, it was too late for Ming the Mollusc(\u8f6f\u4f53\u52a8\u7269), named after the Chinese dynasty when its life began. Unfortunately researchers who calculated Ming's age killed it instantly by opening its shell.\n\nThe researchers opened the ancient clam up to judge its age by counting growth rings inside. But the rings were so close together that scientists ended up having to count the rings on the outside to be accurate, leading CBS journalists to point out that if scientists had just started there, Ming could have lived on. Now, after examining the quahog more closely, using more advanced methods, the researchers have found the animal was actually 100 years older than they first thought.\n\n Dr Paul Butler, from the University's School of Ocean Sciences, said: \u201cWe got it wrong the first time and maybe we were a bit hasty publishing our findings back then. But we are absolutely certain that we've got the right age now.\u201d The mollusc was born in 1499 \u2013 just seven years after Columbus discovered America and before Henry VIII had even married his first wife, Catherine of Aragon in 1509.\n\n A quahog's shell grows by a layer every year, in the summer when the water is warmer and food is plentiful. It means that when its shell is cut in half, scientists can count the lines in a similar way that trees can be dated by rings in their trunks.\n\n Jan Heinemeier, associate professor at the University of Denmark, who helped date Ming, told Science Nordic: \u201cThe fact that we got our hands on a 507-year-old animal is incredibly fascinating, but the really exciting thing is of course everything we can learn from studying the mollusk.\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:At first, the scientists found that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why did the scientists open the ancient clam up?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The sixth paragraph is mainly about\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\u00a0\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following is NOT true?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Where does the text probably come from?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g2/201408/2w8fg203451296.html"},

As of March 13, 12 different countries, including Malaysia, China, Vietnam and the US, were searching for the plane.\n\n The disappearance is an \u201caviation (\u822a\u7a7a) mystery\u201d, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the head of Malaysia's Civil Aviation Authority, said on March 10.There was no clear sign of a crash by March 13.\n\n Between 1-2 hours after takeoff, the plane suddenly lost contact with people on the ground. The weather was clear, and the pilots didn't make any calls . No evidence was found in the area where the flight last made contact.

{"answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n", "content": "MONTAGNE: In the summer of 2011, the world first heard of a small island in Norway under the most terrible of circumstances. Utoya Island was a youth camp run by Norway's Labor Party. One day in July, a heavily armed, right-wing extremist stepped onto the island and began shooting at random. Sixty-nine people died, over 100 were wounded; almost all, young people. This month, artist Jonas Dahlberg was appointed to create a memorial. He described to us the experience he imagines for those who come to the island.\n\nDAHLBERG: You start your walk through a forest of evergreens on a wooden pathway. After a while, this pathway starts to go down into the landscape.\n\nMONTAGNE: Down into the landscape, and into a short tunnel. When you come out, you are unable to go any farther. You can't get to the tip of the island because it has been cut off. So all you can do is look across a narrow channel of water at what is now a wall of polished stone, carved with the names of the dead.\n\nDAHLBERG: It becomes almost like a gravestone. You cannot reach it. It's close enough to be able to read, but it's forever lost for your possibility to reach.\n\nMONTAGNE: It's being called \n\n. Exactly what do you mean by that?\n\nDAHLBERG: During my first site visit, the experience of seeing those gunshots\u2014and you can see it was like being in an open wound. And it took me to a stage of deep sadness where it was hard to breathe. So I didn't want to illustrate loss; I wanted to make actual loss. It's just a cut through the island.\n\nMONTAGNE: On the day of the massacre, just hours before launching his shooting on the island, the killer set off a bomb in downtown Oslo, leaving eight people dead. As those events were unfolding, artist Jonas Dahlberg had been out with his brother, and stopped in at a seaside village.\n\nDAHLBERG: In the harbor, it was silent, and this is the higher end of summer. So, it's normally a very lively place. And it was total silence there; and it was a very, very strange feeling in the whole small village. And it's totally impossible to grasp what is going on. And then it just kept on. It's still almost impossible to understand it. It's also one of the reasons why it's so important with memorials for these kind of things. It's to maybe help a little bit to understand what was happening. So it's not just about remembering. It's also about trying to just understand.\n\nMONTAGNE: Artist Jonas Dahlberg designed the memorial for the 69 who died at a youth camp on Utoya Island. The attack was the deadliest in Norway since World War II. That memorial will open in 2015. And to see a virtual version of what it will look like, go to our website, at npr.org.

Five years after bankruptcy(\u7834\u4ea7), its profits were beyond expectations and its share price was rising. But the new boss's to-do list was long: fixing GM's loss-making European arm, keeping up momentum(\u52bf\u5934) in China amid signs of a slowdown and giving new life to the product line. The former CEO, Dan Akerson, warned her that she would also face unexpected challenges. The first has arrived sooner than she might have expected.\n\nWhat appeared to be a routine recall(\u53ec\u56de) of about 800,000 older models, linked to a faulty ignition(\u70b9\u706b) switch, has turned out to be anything but. The number of cars recalled has leapt to more than 2.6 million. The company's clumsy handling of a safety problem that first became apparent a decade ago is now linked to the deaths of at least 13 motorists.\n\nCalled before Congress to answer for GM's failings Ms Barra said she was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d but insisted that the post-bankruptcy \u201cnew GM\u201d was not like the \u201cold GM\u201d, which had failed to deal with the ignition switches for years. Politicians and the public alike want to know how such a problem could have remained unaddressed for so long.\n\nCars are becoming ever more complex machines, with thousands of mechanical and electronic parts. Last year it happened to 22 million vehicles in America, compared with 18 million in 2012. In fact, GM was one of only three brands that recalled fewer vehicles than it sold. Minor problems, like squeaks(\u5431\u5431\u54cd) or rattles(\u5361\u55d2\u54cd), that do not affect safety are more common still. They may be fixed at a routine service; the owner may never know. The growing number of recalls is proof to an improving system for picking up faults. \n\nBut it is very complicated. Dealers must record replacements of parts under warranty(\u4fdd\u4fee). The carmaker needs to spot the trend, recognize it as a problem and then determine whether or not it is a design fault that requires an extensive replacement. It relies on accurate recording of every warranty replacement in every region. This system appears to have broken down at \u201cold GM\u201d. Ms Barra needs to find out why.\n\nThe core problem is a widely used ignition switch that has a tendency to slip from the \u201con\u201d position to \u201coff\u201d if a driver uses a heavy key-chain or bounces down a rough road. An improvement was made in 2008 to prevent the problem, which can lead to the engine shutting off, disabling the airbags. But despite a growing list of crashes and deaths, GM failed to order a recall for a component that would have cost a few dollars at most.\n\nThis is odd. Most carmakers want to identify and fix problems speedily despite having to bear the cost of buying and fitting a new component. A small part can do great harm, if bad publicity leads to reputational collapse, lost sales and law suits, including heavy penalties. Appearing to put profits before safety is an invitation to \n\n a firm's shares, as GM has discovered.\n\nSo far Ms Barra has handled the situation well. She seems to have acted as soon as she found out something was wrong. GM has appointed a worldwide safety president to cut through the process that may have delayed investigation and action. And in a sweeping housecleaning, GM has recalled another 2 million vehicles in America alone. GM looks set to accept moral, if not legal, responsibility. The terms of its exit from bankruptcy give immunity to lawsuits for injuries arising beforehand. But GM is likely to compensate survivors' and victims' families anyway.\n\nIt is not yet clear how much of a hammering GM will take. But hours before Ms Barra's meeting with Congress, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety issued a greatly desired \u201cTop Safety Pick\u201d for the new Chevrolet Malibu, one of a growing number of well-received cars from GM. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:When Mary Barra took office, there was plenty more room for GM's improvement in that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\na. the development of Chinese market appears to be slowing down\n\nb. former bosses have failed to fix GM's loss-making European arm\n\nc. some car models lack appeal in the market\n\nd.

After six months of arguing and final 16 hours of hot parliamentary debates, Australia's Northern Territory became the first legal authority in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of incurably ill patients who wish to die. The measure passed by the convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word flashed on the Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess, executive director of the Right to Die Society of Canada.

The NT Rights of the Terminally Ill Law has left physicians and citizens alike trying to deal with its moral and practical implications. Some have breathed sighs of relief, others, including churches, right-to-life groups and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the hurry of its passage. \n\n In Australia\u2014where an aging population, life-extending technology and changing community attitudes have all played their part\u2014other states are going to consider making a similar law to deal with euthanasia (\u5b89\u4e50\u6b7b).

Many village communities feel their countryside is being ruined by the power-producing machines of wind farms; yet they never take \"direct action\", even though the planning laws put them at a severe disadvantage. And the generous subsidies (\u8d22\u653f\u8865\u8d34) , which encourage the expansion of wind power, are not favorable to the village communities and set landowners in conflict with other residents (\u5c45\u6c11) .\n\n Those who disagree with the rapid expansion of wind farms state that the damage they cause is out of proportion(\u6bd4\u4f8b) to the benefits they bring, because their energy output cannot match that of the carbon-based power stations they are supposed to replace. Supporters insist that wind must be part of a mix of renewables, nuclear and carbon, and that the country is committed to meeting EU ( European Union) targets for non-carbon energy generation. \n\n Against this background, the fact that there is an argument within the Government over whether to publish an official report on wind farms' impact on the countryside becomes even more extraordinary. The two parties in the coalition (\u8054\u5408) government are in disagreement over what it should say.\n\nWe have some advice for the two parties: publish the report, and let the country be the judge.\u00a0 Even if it contains evidence that wind farms are harmful, it will hardly be a pleasant surprise to people who do not like them. Equally, supporters must argue their case by acknowledging the concerns and explaining why they are either misplaced or worthy of much attention.\n\n The suggestion that further negotiations are to take place to produce an \"acceptable\" report suggests that the politics of coalition government are doing the country harm in a certain way.

Now a research by Cornell University suggests how life style and decisions about eating may affect weight. Researchers concluded that the French tend to stop eating when they feel full. However, Americans tend to stop when their plate is empty or their favorite TV show is over.\n\n According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, a health expert, the French see eating as an important part of their life style. They enjoy food and therefore spend a fairly long time at the table, while Americans see eating as something to be squeezed between the other daily activities. Mercola believes Americans lose the ability to sense when they are actually full. So they keep eating long after the French would have stopped. In addition, he points out that Americans drive to huge supermarkets to buy canned and frozen foods for the week. The French, instead, tend to shop daily, walking to small shops and farmers' markets where they have a choice of fresh fruits, vegetables, and eggs as well as high-quality meats for each meal.\n\n After a visit to the United States, Mireille Guiliano, author of French Women Don't Get Fat, decided to write about the importance of knowing when to stop rather than suggesting how to avoid food. Today she continues to stay slim and rarely goes to the gym.\n\n In spite of all these differences, evidence shows that recent life style changes may be affecting French eating habits. Today the rate of obesity \u2014 or\u00a0 extreme overweight \u2014 among adults is only 6%. However, as American fast food gains acceptance and the young reject older traditions, the obesity rate among French children has reached 17% \u2014 and is growing.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:In what way are the French different from Americans according to Dr. Joseph Mercola?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:This text is mainly the relationship between \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The text is mainly developed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Where does this text probably come from?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g0/201408/0beqg003454155.html"},

Notably, there were many Japanese reporters present, hoping to break the news that Haruki Murakami had won the prize. Finally, the Swedish Academy's Permanent Secretary Peter Englund stepped out from the doors and said Canadian short story writer Alice Munro has won the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nThe following is a truncated Q\\&A with reporters and Englund. (The questions have been simplified and clarified.)\n\nWhy did Alice Munro win?\n\nWe gave her the Nobel Prize in Literature because she is a master of the contemporary short story.\n\nWhich book to begin with?\n\nOne of the amazing things about her is that she has no weak works in her writing. She has always worked to the best of her ability; she has always cultivated the short story to perfection. And she has never really written a weak or bad book. So you can take your pick. 'The Moons of Jupiter' was the first book I read by her and you can see both her different themes in that book and also her very special narrative mode, you can find it there. She tells her stories a bit like nobody else. She has a very economical language and sparse style. You can find that in 'The Moons of Jupiter.' You can take your pick. The latest one is obviously very interesting, 'Dear Life,' which contains a number of autobiographical sketches at the end that gives a key to the entire authorship of Alice Munro.\n\nHow was she informed?\n\nWell, I left a message on her answering machine. I couldn't reach her and it was of course pretty early in the morning. But she will be notified by courier, by email to her both agents, by standard mail and so on.\n\nWhat kind of message did you leave?\n\nBasically, congratulations! You've won the Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nWhat's the Importance of a woman winning?\n\nDon't ask me. We picked her for excellence, nothing else. Of course it matters when you start doing the headcount. But she is no representative. She has received this prize just because of what she has done. Nothing else.\n\nSo the sexual balance doesn't count?\n\nWe don't have these kinds of quotas; thank god ... We don't have any quotas. We could, if we wanted to, award this prize four times in a row to a children's book writer working in the United States. If we wanted to. We can do as we please. We don't have to fill any quotes in any direction. We just give it to authors who show an extraordinary literary quality. One of these is Mrs. Alice Munro.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Why were there so many Japanese reporters in the Stock Exchange Building in Stockholm's Old Town?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Alice Munro would most probably be informed of her winning by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, Alice Munro was awarded the 2013 Noble Prize in Literature mainly for \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Alice Munro is best known for her work \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/7s83g303454213.html"},

Concrete was poured into the foundations, but the result was that the tower sank further into the soil. \n\nThe straightening work involved digging out around 70 tonnes of earth from the northern side of the tower, causing it to sink on that side.Before the digging started, the tower was fixed with steel ropes and 600 tonnes of lead weights. \n\nHowever, halfway through the project, concerns at the ugliness of the weights led to their removal and the tower leaned greatly.The weights were hurriedly reattached. In one night, the tower moved more than it had averaged in an entire year.The tower's stonework has also been restored. \n\nThe Italian government stepped in after a tower collapsed in Pavia in 1989, killing four people.Experts suddenly realized that the tower at Pisa, which was similarly built and on the same sort of earth, could do the same.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What would be the best title for the passage? \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:According to the passage, the Leaning Tower of Pisa\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What drove the Italian government to save the Leaning Tower of Pisa? \n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What most probably played the most important part in straightening the tower? \n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g0/201408/dav3g003454687.html"},

Differences in \n\nAmerican schools compared with those found in the majority of other countries lie in the fact that \n\neducation here has long been intended for everyone. Schools are expected to meet the needs of every\n\nchild, regardless of ability, and also the needs of society itself. This means that public schools offer more \n\nthan academic subjects.

My own children's school week is framed by pretests, drills, tests, and retests. They know that the best way to read a textbook is to look at the questions at the end of the chapter and then skim the text for the answers. I believe that my daughter Erica, who gets excellent marks, has never read a chapter of any of her school textbooks all the way through. And teachers are often heard to state proudly and openly that they teach to the mandated (\u56fd\u5bb6\u6307\u5b9a\u7684) state test.\n\n Teaching to the test is a curious phenomenon. Instead of deciding what skills students ought to learn, helping students learn them, and then using some reasonable methods of assessment to discover whether students have mastered the skills, teachers are encouraged to reverse the process. First, one looks at a commercially available test. Then, one distills (\u63d0\u53d6) the skills needed not to master reading, say, or math, but to do well on the test. Finally, the test skills are taught.\n\n The ability to read or write or calculate might infer the ability to do reasonably well on standardized tests. However, neither reading nor writing develops simply through being taught to take tests. We must be careful to avoid mistaking preparation for a test of a skill with the acquisition of that skill. Too many discussions of the basics of skills make this fundamental confusion because people are test-centered rather than concerned with the nature and quality of what is taught.\n\n Recently, many schools have faced what could be called the crisis of comprehension or, in simple terms, the phenomenon of students with phonic and grammar skills still being unable to understand what they read. These students are capable of taking tests and filling in workbooks. However, they have little or no experience reading or thinking, and talking about what they read. They know the details but can't see or understand the whole. They are taught to be so concerned with grade that they have' no time or ease of mind to think about meaning, and reread things if necessary.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:As is indicated in the second paragraph, the author finds it strange that \\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The crisis of comprehension most probably results from \\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the author, we can infer that \\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u504f\u96be,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u79d1\u6559\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g2/201408/nc7hg203405464.html"},

The most recent comparative data on the performance of universities and research institutions in Australia, Canada, USA and UK shows that, from a relatively weak starting position, the UK now leads on many indicators of commercialization activity.\n\n\u3000\u3000When viewed at the national level, the \n\n (interference) of the past decade have helped transformed the performances of UK universities. Evidence suggests the UK's position is much stronger than in the recent past and is still showing improvement. But national data masks the very large variation in the performance of individual universities. The evidence shows that a large number of universities have fallen off the back of the pack, a few perform strongly and the rest chase the leaders.\n\n\u3000\u3000This type of uneven distribution is not strange to the UK and is mirrored across other economies. In the UK, research is concentrated: less than 25% of universities are receiving 75% of the research funding. These same universities are also the institutions producing the greatest share of PhD graduates, science citations, patents and license income. The effect of policies generating long-term resource concentration has also created a distinctive set of universities which are research-led and commercially active. It seems clear that the concentration of research and commercialization work creates differences between universities.\n\n\u3000\u3000The core objective for universities which are research-led must be to maximize the impact of their research efforts. Their purpose is not to generate funds to add to the bottom line of the university or to substitute other income streams. Rather, these universities should be generating the widest range of social, economic and environmental benefits. In return for the scale of investment, they should share their expertise (expert knowledge or skill) in order to build greater confidence in the sector.\n\n\u3000\u3000Part of the economic recovery of the UK will be driven by the next generation of research commercialization spilling out of our universities. On the evidence presented in my report, there are three dozen universities in the UK which are actively engaged in advanced research training and commercialization work.\n\n\u3000\u3000If there was a greater coordination\uff08\u534f\u8c03\uff09of technology transfer offices within regions and a simultaneous (happening at the same time) investment in the scale and functions of our graduate schools, universities could, and should, play a key role in positioning the UK for the next growth cycle.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What does the author think of UK universities in terms of commercialization?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does the author say about the national data on UK universities' performance in commercialization?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:We can infer from Paragraph 5 that \u201cpolicy interventions (in Paragraph 4)\u201d refers to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What dose the author suggest research-led universities do?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u79d1\u6559\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/x7kwg303428363.html"},

A new iPhone application (\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f) MealSnap may help. Users just need to take a picture of the meal with the phone, and it will give a calorie read-out almost immediately.\n\nMealSnap was developed by DailyBurn, a health social network that focuses on helping its users lead healthier lifestyles. It has created several other health and diet-related iPhone applications. The application gives users a quick reply. To do that, it matches the taken picture to a databank (\u6570\u636e\u5e93) with the calorie information of nearly 500,000 kinds of food. Users then get the range of calories for the meal that is photographed.\n\nWe started with something simple\u2014an apple. A couple of minutes later, the application replied that it was an apple and between 64 and 96 calories. More impressive was the reply we received after sending a photo of a mixed salad bowl. MealSnap replied that the bowl contained \u201cyellow rice with corn, boiled eggs and beans\u201d and that the food was between 532 and 789 calories.\n\nMr. Smith, director of DailyBurn, said that usual calorie counting needed a long time, but that the application made it easier to know the calories in food. That is why it is so popular among those who are trying hard to lose weight.\n\nIn addition, MealSnap can act as a food diary. No need to write down what they've eaten, the photoes will be stored. The users can keep a visual log (\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55). Mr. Smith said, \u201cit's like a food journey, but easier. All you do is to take the picture. The simple act of recording something can cause a psychological (\u5fc3\u7406\u7684) change that can help people on their health journey.

Judging from the experiment of Frederick in the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.\n\nAll the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.\n\nToday no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If there sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.\n\nExperts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months they can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to five words. At three he knows about 1,000 words, which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern \u201ctoy bear\u201d. And even more incredible is the young brain's ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.\n\nBut speech has to be induced\uff08\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u5f15\u8d77\uff09, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the children's babbling\uff08\u54bf\u5440\u58f0\uff09,grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The writer mentioned the experiment of Frederick to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The purpose of Frederick's experiment was to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The reason why some children are backward in speaking is most probably that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984: If a child starts to speak later than others, he will \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ in future.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98986: According to the passage, the writer agrees that\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u79d1\u6559\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/e6k0g303454395.html"},

These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two.\n\nWe spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype \uff08\u7f51\u7edc\u7535\u8bdd\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff09. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. BARRY BROWN: \u201cAnd they just\u00a0plugged\u00a0in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\u201d\n\nMr Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. BARRY BROWN: \u201cOne problem with a lot of the GPS units is that they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn. Because they just give you the next turn, sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the\u00a0overview\u00a0that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\u201d\n\nBarry Brown formerly served as a professor with the University of California, San Diego. While there, he worked on a project with Eric Laurier from the University of Edinburgh. The two men studied the effects of GPS devices on driving by placing cameras in people's cars. They wrote a paper based on their research. It is called \u201cThe Normal, Natural Troubles of Driving with GPS.\u201d\n\nIt lists several areas where GPS systems can cause confusion for drivers. These include maps that are outdated, incorrect or difficult to understand. They also include timing issues(\u65f6\u673a\u95ee\u9898) related to when GPS commands are given.\n\nBarry Brown says, \u201c To make GPS systems better we need a better understanding of how drivers, passengers and GPS systems work together.\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:In paragraph 2, Mr. Brown mentioned his friend in the conversation to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What is the disadvantage of small screens in GPS equipment according to the text?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983: Which of the following statements would Barry Brown most likely agree with?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is Mr. Brown's attitude towards GPS?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Which of the following statements can best describe the main idea of the pasage?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u79d1\u6559\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g2/201408/eut0g203454414.html"},

As long as people eat enough milk, eggs and meat alternates(\u66ff\u4ee3\u7269), they can get enough protein.\n\n2. Fresh vegetables cooked at home are always more nutritious than canned vegetables.\n\nFalse. The difference depends more on how vegetables are prepared than whether they are fresh or canned. Vegetables cooked in too much water can lose a large quantity of vitamins.\n\n3. Food eaten between meals can be just as good for health as food eaten at regular meals.\n\nTrue.

Taking extra vitamins beyond the recommended daily allowances won't give you more energy.\n\nTrue. It's widely believed that extra vitamins provide more energy.

It\n\nis a legal requirement that all kids be educated, though.

Home schooled students can learn just as much as they would in regular school if they and their parents work hard to cover all the subjects and experiences necessary. Parents who home school usually have higher levels of education than parents who do not.

They are more of a clear, yellowish colour. Although blood looks red when it's outside the body, when it's sitting in a vein near the surface of the skin, it's more of a dark reddish purple colour. At the right depth, these blood-filled veins reflect less red light than the surrounding skin, making them look blue by comparison.\n\nWhich works harder, your heart or your brain?\n\nThat kind of depends on whether you're busy thinking or busy exercising. Your heart works up to three times harder during exercise, and shifts enough blood over a lifetime to fill a supertanker. But, in the long run, your brain probably tips it, because even when you're sitting still your brain is using twice as much as your heart, and it takes four to five times as much blood to feed it.\n\nWhy do teeth fall out, and why don't they grow back in grown-up?\n\nBaby (or \u201cmilk\u201d) teeth do not last long; they fall out to make room for bigger, stronger adult teeth later on. Adult teeth fall out when they become damaged, decayed and infected by bacteria. Once this second set of teeth has grown in, you're done. When they're gone, they're gone. This is because nature figures you're set for life, and what controls regrowth of your teeth switches off.\n\nDo old people shrink as they age?\n\nYes and no. Many people do get shorter as they age. But, when they do, it isn't because they're shrinking all over. They simply lose height as their spine(\u810a\u67f1)becomes shorter and more curved due to disuse and the effects of gravity\uff08\u91cd\u529b\uff09. Many (but not all) men and women do lose height as they get older. Men lose an average of 3\u20144 cm in height as they age, while women may lose 5 cm or more. If you live to be 200 years old, would you keep shrinking till you were, like 60 cm tall, like a little boy again? No, because old people don't really shrink! It is not that they are growing backwards\u2014their legs, arms and backbones getting shorter. When they do get shorter, it's because the spine has shortened a little. Or, more often, become more bent and curved.\n\nWhy does spinning make you dizzy(\u7729\u6655\u7684)?\n\nBecause your brain gets confused between what you're seeing and what you're feeling. The brain senses that you're spinning using special gravity-and-motion-sensing organs in your inner ear, which work together with your eyes to keep your vision and balance stable. But, when you suddenly stop spinning the system goes out control, and your brain thinks you're moving while you're not!\n\nWhere do feelings and emotions come from?\n\nMostly from an ancient part of the brain called the limbic system. All mammals have this brain area\u2014from mice to dogs, cats, and humans. So all mammals feel basic emotions like fear, pain and pleasure. But since human feelings also involve other, newer bits of the brain, we feel more complex emotions than any other animals on the planet.\n\nIf exercise wears you out, how can it be good for you?\n\nBecause our bodies adapt to everything we do to them.

It's reported that it lives in the shadows(\u9634\u6697\u5904) of Mt. Saint Helens. It has purple skin, red eyes and the character is quite similar to the bat's. Since reports tell it likes eating small animals like chickens, goats and pigs, some believe that it is actually a flying primate(\u7075\u957f\u76ee\u52a8\u7269). But researchers say that it is more closely related to the fruit bat of northern America.\n\nFear still fills the hearts of men, women and children of Washington. In May of 1980 during the eruption of Mount Saint Helens, the Batsquatch showed itself in the shadows of clouds from the eruption. In 1994, a local mountaineer was able to take pictures of the Batspuatch making the rumor(\u8c23\u8a00) seem real. During this event some farm animals seemed to disappear though luckily no humans were reported missing at the time. The local mountaineer told about his meeting with the Batsquatch. When he suddenly heard a loud deep voice from the shadows, the mountaineer was knocked down. He tried to look for the creature(\u751f\u7269) that had made the sound. He saw a great creature with purple wings in the sky. It looked like it was about 30 feet tall.\n\nThe mountaineer kept this story a secret in fear of being laughed at by others but when new stories came in about the Batsquatch he shared his story.\n\nThe reality of the Batsquatch can no longer be ignored. It is only a creature that is trying to live. Respect! This is how we should take news such as this.

Many people think that they have to accept whatever life throws at them. They'll say, \"This is my destiny. I cannot change it.\"\n\nOf course not! You don't have to suffer needlessly. Your life depends on you, not on other factors.\n\nI know a woman who says she just accepts what life gives her because she has done everything she can to improve it. Guess what her lifestyle is? She wakes up in the morning, goes to work, comes back home, relaxes, chats with people, watches TV, and then goes to sleep. Next day, the same routine cycle follows.\n\nHuh! Is this what she calls \"doing her best\"? She believes she has tried her best and just accepts it in her heart that this is the life that has been intended for her and that her luck can only change if God wills it. She hasn't realized that we have to do our share of making the effort to live the life of our dreams.\n\nRemember that you harvest what you sow. You have to get off the sofa, get your eyes off the TV screen, get your hands off the phone (unless it's helpful to your success), and get your mind and body to work! Don't expect your luck to change, unless you do something about it. If something goes wrong, don't just regard it as a temporary(\u6682\u65f6\u7684) problem; Instead, learn your lesson, make the most of the situation, and do something to solve the problem. It's not enough to think positively; you also have to act positively.\n\nIf someone's life is in trouble, do you just hope and pray that things will turn out fine? Of course not! You get to do anything you can to save the person. So it is with your own life. It is not enough to hope for the best, but you have to do your best.

This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise\u2014and as a result, we are aging unnecessarily soon.\n\nProfessor Taiju Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern Japan appeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a relatively early age, and how the process of aging could be slowed down.\n\nWith a team of colleagues at Tokyo National University, he set about measuring brain volumes of a thousand people of different ages and varying occupations.\n\nComputer technology enabled the researchers to obtain precise measurements of the volume of the front and side sections of the brain, which relate to intellect (\u667a\u80fd) and emotion, and determine the human character. (The rear section of the brain, which controls functions like eating and breathing, does not contract with age, and one can continue living without intellectual or emotional faculties.)\n\nContraction of front and side parts\u2014as cells die off\u2014was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not evident in some sixty- and seventy-year-olds.\n\nMatsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple remedy to the contraction normally associated with age\u2014using the head.\u00a0 The findings show in general terms that contraction of the brain begins sooner in people in the country than in the towns. Those least at risk, says Matsuzawa, are lawyers, followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing routine work in government offices are, however, as likely to have shrinking brains as the farm worker, bus driver and shop assistant. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking.

It now makes up a third of a typical household's waste in the UK. In many supermarkets nowadays food items are packaged twice with plastic and cardboard.\n\nToo much packaging is doing serious damage to the environment. The UK, for example, is running out of it for burying this unnecessary waste. If such packaging is burnt, it gives off greenhouse gases which go on to cause the greenhouse effect. Recycling helps, but the process itself uses energy. The solution is not to produce such items in the first place. Food waste is a serious problem, too. Too many supermarkets encourage customers to buy more than they need. However, few of them are coming round to the idea that this cannot continue, encouraging customers to reuse their plastic bags, for example.\n\nBut this is not just about supermarkets. It is about all of us. We have learned to associate packaging with quality. We have learned to think that something unpackaged is of poor quality. This is especially true of food. But it is also applied to a wide range of consumer products, which often have far more packaging than necessary.\n\nThere are signs of hope.

Wind is one of our cleanest and richest power sources, as well as one of the oldest. Evidence shows that windmills (\u98ce\u8f66) began to be used in ancient Iran back in the seventh century BC. They were first introduced to Europe during the 1100s, when armies returned from the Middle East with knowledge of using wind power.\n\nFor many centuries, people used windmills to grind (\u78e8\u788e) wheat into flour or pump water from deep underground. When electricity was discovered in the late 1800s, people living in remote (\u504f\u50fb\u7684) areas began to use them to produce electricity. This allowed them to have electric lights and radio. However, by the 1940s when electricity was available to people in almost all areas of the United States, windmills were rarely used.\n\nDuring the 1970s, people started becoming concerned about the pollution that is created when coal and gas are burned to produce electricity. People also realized that the supply of coal and gas would not last forever. Then, wind was rediscovered, though it means high costs.

So far, he and his team have not succeeded, though they have cloned two cows and a cat.\n\nThey just might succeed in cloning Missy soon \u2014 or perhaps not for another five years.\n\nWesthusin's experience with cloning animals leaves him upset by all this talk of human cloning. In three years of work on the Missy project, using hundreds upon hundreds of dog's eggs, the A\\&M team has produced only a dozen or so embryos carrying Missy's DNA. None have survived the transfer to a surrogate\uff08\u4ee3\u5b55\u7684\uff09mother. The wastage of eggs and the many spontaneously aborted(\u6d41\u4ea7\uff0c\u53d1\u80b2\u4e0d\u5168) fetuses\uff08\u80ce\uff09may be acceptable when you're dealing with cats or bulls, he argues, but not with humans. \u201cCloning is incredibly inefficient, and also dangerous,\u201d he says.\n\nEven so, dog cloning is a commercial opportunity, with a nice research payoff. Ever since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996, Westhusin's phone has been ringing with people calling in hopes of duplicating their cats and dogs, cattle and horses. \u201cA lot of people want to clone pets, especially if the price is right,\u201d says Westhusin. Cost is no obstacle for Missy's mysterious billionaire owner; he's put up \\$3.7 million so far to fund A\\&M's research.\n\nContrary to some media reports, Missy is not dead. The owner wants a twin to carry on Missy's fine qualities after she does die. The prototype\uff08\u539f\u578b\uff1b\u96cf\u5f62\uff09is, by all accounts, athletic, good-natured and super-smart. Missy's master does not expect an exact copy of her. He knows her clone may not have her temperament\uff08\u6c14\u8d28\u3001\u6027\u60c5\uff09. In a statement of purpose, Missy's owner and the A\\&M team say they are \u201cboth looking forward to studying the ways that her clones differ from Missy.\u201d\n\nBesides cloning a great dog, the project may contribute insight into the old question of nature vs. nurture. It could also lead to the cloning of special rescue dogs and many endangered animals.\n\nHowever, Westhusin is cautious about his work. He knows that even if he gets a dog pregnant, the offspring, should they survive, will face the problems shown at birth by other cloned animals: abnormalities like immature lungs and heart and weight problems~ \u201cWhy would you ever want to clone humans,\u201d Westhusin asks, \u201cwhen we're not even close to getting it worked out in animals yet?\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:By \u201cstupid endeavor\u201d, Westhusin means to say that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does the second paragraph tell us about Westhusin's dog cloning project?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:By cloning Missy, Mark Westhusin hopes to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:We learn from the passage that animal clones are likely to have \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:What's the best title of the passage?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u79d1\u6559\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g2/201408/0swbg203455186.html"},

Her parents criticized her school for failing to protect her. Officials have brought criminal charges against several teenagers.\n\nJudy Kuczynski is president of an anti-bullying group called Bully Police USA. Her daughter Tina was the victim of severe bullying starting in middle school in the state of Minnesota. Her said, \"Our daughter was a very outgoing child. She was a bubbly personality, very involved in all kinds of things, had lots of friends. And over a period of time her grades fell completely. She started having health issues. She couldn't sleep. She wasn't eating. She had terrible stomach pains. She started clenching her jaw and grinding her teeth at night.

Or it can be verbal \u2014 for example, insults or threats. Spreading lies about someone or excluding a person from a group is known as social or relational bullying.\n\nAnd now there is cyber bullying, which uses the Internet, e-mail or text messages. It has easy appeal for the bully because it does not involve face-to-face contact and it can be done at any time.\n\nThe first serious research studies into bullying were done in Norway in the late 1970s. The latest government study in the United States was released last year. It found that about one-third of students age twelve to eighteen were bullied at school.\n\nSusan Sweater is a psychologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network.

Also, it's bad for Internet service providers. They will suffer in the long run because fewer people will pay for an Internet service if they know they can get it for free.

I think the police are totally right to arrest these criminals.\n\n\u2014 by Sandra Wilkins\n\nBasically, if the person who paid for the service still has everything they paid for, what's the problem? It's just like using the light from streetlamps to read your book, or watching someone else's firework display. It's not stealing.\n\nAlso, if you leave your wireless connection unsecured, then it is your own fault(\u8fc7\u9519) if someone else uses it. Just as you wouldn't leave your front door unlocked, or your car door open, neither should you leave your wireless connection open. By leaving your wireless connection open, you are inviting people to use it. Securing your wireless connection is as easy as clicking a few settings on your router(\u8def\u7531\u5668).

One expert on Cities wrote: Cities of the future would not be crowded, but would have space for farms and fields. People would travel to work in \u201cairbuses\u201d, large all-weather helicopters carrying up to 200 passengers. When a person left the airbus station he could drive a coin-operated car equipped with radar. The radar equipment of cars would make traffic accidents \u201calmost unheard of\u201d. Does that sound familiar? If the expert had been accurate it would, because he was writing in 1957. His subject was \u201cThe city of 1982\u201d.\n\nIf the professionals sometimes sound like high school students, it's probably because future study is still a new field. But economic forecasting, or predicting what the economy will do, has been around for a long time. It should be accuate, and generally it is. But there have been some big mistakes in the field, too. In early 1929, most forecasters saw an excellent future for the stock market. In October of that year, the stock market had its worst losses ever, ruining thousands of investors who had put their faith in financial foreseers.\n\nOne forecaster knew that predictions about the future would always be subject to significant error.

From Boston to Los Angeles it is as far as from France to Central Asia, and from east to west there are five time zones; but everywhere people get up and go to bed at about the same time, eat the same kind of food, buy in the same kind of shops, work and rest at the same times of the day and have the same pattern of holidays. In\n\nthat matter there is less difference between rich people and ordinary people, or between town and country, than in any single European nation.\n\nAlthough the United States covers so much land and the land produces far more food than the present population needs, its people are by now almost entirely an urban society. Less than a tenth of the people are engaged in agriculture, and most of the rest live in or around towns, large and small.

You are so lucky.\u201d\n\n Perhaps your family and friends said similar things to you when you left home. But is it true all the time? Is your life in the new country always wonderful and exciting?\n\nSpecialists say that it isn't that easy to get used to life in a new culture. \u201cCulture shock\u201d (\u51b2\u51fb) is the term specialists use when talking about the feelings that people have in a new environment. \u201cThere are three stages of culture shock,\u201d say the specialists. In the first stage, the newcomers like their new environment. Then, when the fresh experience dies, they begin to hate the city, the country, the people, and everything else. In the last stage, the newcomers adapt to their surroundings and finally enjoy their life there.\n\n Culture shock arises from many obvious factors. The weather may be unpleasant. The customs may be different. The public service systems such as the telephone, post office, or transportation may be difficult to work out. Even the simplest things become headaches. Still worse, the language may be difficult.\n\nWho feels culture shock? Everyone does in this way or that. But culture shock surprises most people. Very often the people having the worst culture shock are those who never had any difficulties in their home countries and were successful in their community. Coming to a new country, these people find they do not have the same established positions. They find themselves without a role, almost without an identity. They have to build a new self\u00adimage.\n\nCulture shock leads to a feeling of disorientation (\u8ff7\u60d8). This feeling may be homesickness. When homesick, people feel like staying inside all the time. They want to protect themselves from the strange environment, and create and escape inside their room for a sense of security. This escape does solve the problem of culture shock for the short term, but it does nothing to make the person familiar with the culture. Getting to know the new environment and gaining experience are the long term solutions to the problem of culture shock.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:When people move to a new country, they \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Based on the passage, which of the following results from culture shock?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, the more successful you are at home, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following statements is correct according to the passage?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u793e\u4f1a\u73b0\u8c61\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/8wpdg303451752.html"},

It is not easy to explain why one person is intelligent and another is not, or why one is cooperative and another is competitive.\u00a0\n\nSocial scientists are of course extremely interested in these types of questions. They want to explain why we possess certain characteristics and exhibit certain behavior. There are no clear answers yet, but two distinct schools of thought on the matter have developed. As one might expect, the two approaches are very different from each other, and there is a great deal of debate between \n\nof each theory. The controversy is often conveniently referred to as \u201cnature and nurture\u201d\uff0e\n\n Those who support the \u201cnature\u201d side of the conflict believe that our personalities and behavior patterns are largely determined by biological factors. That our environment has little, if anything, to do with our abilities, characteristics and behavior is central to this theory. Taken to an extreme\uff0cthis theory states that our behavior is predetermined to such a great degree that we are almost completely governed by our instincts(\u672c\u80fd)\uff0e\n\n Proponents of the \u201cnurture\u201d theory, or, as they are often called, behaviorists, claim that our environment is more important than our biologically based instincts in determining how we will act. A behaviorist, B. F. Skinner, sees humans as beings whose behavior is almost completely shaped by their surroundings. The behaviorists' view of the human being is quite mechanistic. They state that, like machines, humans respond to environmental stimuli (\u523a\u6fc0) as the basis of their behavior.\u00a0\n\nSocially and politically, the consequences of these two theories are far-reaching. In the US\uff0cfor example, blacks often score below whites on standardized intelligence tests. This leads some \u201cnature\u201d proponents to conclude that blacks are genetically lower in status than whites. Behaviorists, on the contrary, say that the differences in scores are due to the fact that blacks are often robbed of many of the educational and other environmental advantages that whites enjoy, and that, as a result, they do not develop the same responses that whites do. \n\n Neither of these theories can yet fully explain human behavior. In fact, it is quite likely that the key to our behavior lies somewhere between these two extremes and that the controversy will continue for a long time is certain.\u00a0\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:This passage is mainly concerned with \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The underlined word \u201cproponents\u201d in Paragraph 2 means \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:In Paragraph 5, the author mainly writes about \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What's the author's purpose in writing the passage? \n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u793e\u4f1a\u73b0\u8c61\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g2/201408/dqwhg203451908.html"},

The more reliable way you can determine their true inner feelings and thoughts is by reading their body language. Everybody communicates using these gestures and if you understand the gestures and their meanings you will be able to read people and know what they are really communicating to you.

Progress indicates a person's ability to change the way he is living at the moment. Progress must lead a better way of doing things. All these, however, remains true only in so far as people want to accept technology and move forward by finding new and more efficient ways of doing things.\n\nHowever, at the back of the minds of many people, especially those who missed the \u201cgood old days\u201d, \n\n. When communication becomes efficient, people are able to contact one another no matter where they are and at whatever time they wish to. The click of a button allows people miles apart to talk or to see each other without even leaving their homes. With the communication \n\n, such as mobile phones and ipads, people often do not take the effect to visit one another personally. A personal visit carries with it the additional feature of having to be in the person's presence for as long as the visit lasts. We cannot unnecessarily excuse our selves or turn the other person off.\n\nWith efficiency also comes mass production. Such is the nature of factories and the success of industrialization today. Factories have improved efficiency. Unskillful tasks are left to machines and products are better made and produced with greater accuracy than any human hand could ever have done. However, with the improvements in efficiency also comes the loss of the personal touch when making these products. For example, many handcrafts(\u624b\u5de5\u827a\u54c1) are now produced in a factory. Although this means that supply is better able to increase demand, now that the supply is quick and efficient, the demand might fall because mass production lowers the quality of the handicraft and it is difficult to find unique designs on each item.\n\nNevertheless, we must not commit the mistake of analyzing progress only from one point of view. In fact, progress has allowed tradition to keep up. It is only with progress and the invention of new technology that many old products can be brought back to their old state. New technology is required for old products to stay old.\n\nIt is people's attitude towards progress that causes the type of influence that technology has on society. Technology is flexible. There is no fixed way of making use of it. Everything depends on people's attitude. The worst effects of progress will fall on those who are unable to rethink their attitudes and views of society. When we accept progress and adapt it to suit our needs, a new \u201cpast\u201d is created.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to Paragraph 1, progress can benefit people when they are willing to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The underlined word \u201cgadgets\u201d is closest in meaning to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The author explains \u201cefficiency comes with a price\u201d by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Compared with home-made handicrafts, machine made products \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:What can be learned about technology from Paragraph 4?\n\n\u5c0f\u98986:What can be concluded from the last paragraph?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u793e\u4f1a\u73b0\u8c61\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g0/201408/vn2kg003453984.html"},

Animals can't talk, but can they lie in other ways? Can they lie with their bodies and behavior? Animal experts may not call it lying, but they do agree that many animals, from birds to chimpanzees, behave dishonestly to fool other animals. Why? Dishonesty often helps them survive. \n\nMany kinds of birds are very successful at fooling other animals. For example, a bird called the plover sometimes pretends to be hurt in order to protect its young. When a predator\uff08\u730e\u98df\u52a8\u7269\uff09gets close to its nest, the plover leads the predator away from the nest. How? It pretends to have a broken wing. The predator follows the \"hurt\" adult, leaving the baby birds safe in the nest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnother kind of bird, the scrub jay, buries its food so it always has something to eat. Scrub jays are also thieves. They watch where others bury their food and steal it. But clever scrub jays seem to know when a thief is watching them. So they go back later, unbury the food, and bury it again somewhere else.\n\nBirds called cuckoos have found a way to have babies without doing much work. How? They don't make nests. Instead, they get into other birds' nests secretly. Then they lay their eggs and fly away. When the baby birds come out, their adoptive parents feed them. \n\nChimpanzees, or chimps, can also be sneaky. After a fight, the losing chimp will give its hand to the other. When the winning chimp puts out its hand, too, the chimps are friendly again. But an animal expert once saw a losing chimp take the winner's hand and start fighting again. \n\nChimps are sneaky in other ways, too. When chimps find food that they love, such as bananas, it is natural for them to cry out. Then other chimps come running. But some clever chimps learn to cry very softly when they find food. That way, other chimps don't hear them,\u00a0 and they don't need to share their food.\n\nAs children, many of us learn the saying \"You can't fool Mother Nature.\" But maybe you can't trust her, either.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:A plover protects its young from a predator by\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:By \"Chimpanzees, or chimps, can also be sneaky\" (paragraph 5), the author means\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following is true according to the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following might be the best title of the passage?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u793e\u4f1a\u73b0\u8c61\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g0/201408/jeu1g003454018.html"},

In microcosm(\u5fae\u89c2\u4e16\u754c), my school is proof of just how global. Monkseaton High School is an ordinary state-funded school of 850 students in the unfashionable part of northeastern England. Over the past seven years it has sent 12 students to American universities --- two of them to Harvard. Monkseaton has, in turn, attracted students from other countries, including Germany and Latvia. Monkseaton now almost routinely receives inquiries from students in Eastern European countries. Obviously, learning English is a big draw, but his pattern of student movement was unheard of five years ago.\n\nThe brain drain is a universal phenomenon, and countries that don't face up to the new reality will be losing some of their most precious resources. The northeast of England is its poorest region, and has experienced a severe loss of highly qualified professionals-to-be. Some of the most able 18-year-olds are going to other parts of Britain, even to other countries. What is happening here is happening to Britain as a whole. Most noticeably, there is a growing trend of British students taking degrees in American universities. This year the number will break the psychological barrier of 1,000 students for the first time.\n\nAnd what is happening at the secondary-school level is happening to higher education. Wherever they come from, today's students have a very different perspective on education from their parents. Because of television, the Internet and their travels, these students see the world as a much smaller place than their parents once did. They are more confident in accepting the challenge of moving from one country to another, from one culture to another; in many cases they can even apply to schools over the Internet. Students are also more aware of the overall cost of education and are looking for value for money. Plus, for many, education linked to travel is a better option than education at home.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:\u00a0 Why does the author say education has become a global enterprise?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: What can we infer about northeast England from the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983: According to the passage, students today have different perspective from their parents on the following EXCEPT that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984: The students today tend to see the world as a much smaller place NOT because \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985: The purpose of the author in writing this passage is to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u793e\u4f1a\u73b0\u8c61\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/vzjbg303454392.html"},

So, as a police officer, I have some urgent things to say to good people. Day after day my men and I struggle to hold back a tidal wave of crime. Something has gone terribly wrong with our once-proud American way of life. It has happened in the area of values. A key ingredient is disappearing, and I think I know what it is: accountability.\n\nAccountability isn't hard to define. It means that every person is responsible for his or her actions and liable for their consequences.\n\nOf the many values that hold civilization together --- honesty, kindness, and so on --- accountability may be the most important of all. Without it, there can be no respect, no trust, no law --- and, ultimately, no society.\n\nMy job as a police officer is to impose accountability on people who refuse, or have never learned, to impose it on themselves. But as every policeman knows, external controls on people's behavior are far less effective than internal restraints such as guilt, shame and embarrassment.\n\nFortunately there are still communities --- smaller towns, usually --- where schools maintain discipline and where parents hold up standards that declare: \u201cIn this family certain things are not tolerated --- they simply are not done!\u201d\n\nYet more and more, especially in our larger cities and suburbs, these inner restraints are loosening. Your typical robber has none. He considers your property his property; he takes what he wants, including your life if you annoy him.\n\nThe main cause of this breakdown is a radical shift in attitudes. Thirty years ago, if a crime was committed, society was considered the victim. Now, in a shocking reversal, it's the criminal who is considered victimized: by his underprivileged (\u88ab\u5265\u593a\u57fa\u672c\u793e\u4f1a\u6743\u5229\u7684) upbringing, by the school that didn't teach him to read, by the church that failed to reach him with moral guidance, by the parents who didn't provide a stable home.\n\nI don't believe it. Many others in equally disadvantaged circumstances choose not to engage in criminal activities. If we free the criminal, even partly, from accountability, we become a society of endless excuses where no one accepts responsibility for anything. We in America desperately need more people who believe that the person who commits a crime is the one responsible for it..\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What the wise man said suggests that it's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: According to the author, if a person is found guilty of a crime, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:\u00a0 Compared with those in small towns, people in large cities have \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984: The writer is sorry to have noticed that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985: The key point of the passage is that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u793e\u4f1a\u73b0\u8c61\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/puxxg303454394.html"},

However, there are now 15 countries in the EU, with a total of 12 languages. EU documents must be translated into all these languages\uff0cand at official meetings, the speeches must be translated into all the languages by interpreters.\n\n All this translating is very expensive and time consuming . It is said that nearly half of all employees of the EU are engaged in translating documents and speeches, and nearly half of the EU's administrative (\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684) costs are spent on this task\uff0eIn the near future it is probable that several more countries, most of them having their own languages, will join the EU, thus making the situation even worse. \n\n The problem is not just cost\uff1athere are practical difficulties as well.

However, any action to reduce the number of official languages (perhaps to four or five) would be a blow to the pride of the smaller countries.

Outside a church in some Scottish town or village a small crowd has interrupted its daily affairs to gather on the pavement. Near the west door a dozen or so overdressed people are glancing impatiently at their watches. The men seem a little self-conscious in their hired kilts; the women hold their wind-blown dresses and loudly admire each other's hats. They are all lively and talkative, yet at the same time strangely reserved. The crowd ignores them, barely noticing when they disappear into the church. Even the arrival of the groom rouses little excitement. These participants are not the main attraction. We are waiting for the bride.\n\nWhatever her age or appearance, everyone will smile and express approval. By convention, all brides are beautiful. Nobody says so, but the spectators feel cheated unless she steps out of a car, dressed in white from head to toe. The nearer she matches their image, the greater their satisfaction. This event is not merely a wedding; it is a tradition, and such occasions are potentially dangerous. Participants must pay strict attention to detail. An untraditional bride destroys the magic.\n\nWhen the crowd has left, some bystanders will remain to watch the bride walk out of church on the arm of her groom. The guests troop out behind the happy couple and all gather on the pavement with an obvious air of relief. A piper strikes up Mairi's Wedding and the guests start shouting and jumping everywhere, putting the photographer off his work. Before bride and groom lead their party to the reception, someone is sure to disobey the priest and scatter forbidden confetti (\u4e94\u5f69\u788e\u7eb8).\n\nThe particulars of this scene are modern; yet three elements are present that have existed since marriage in Scotland began\u2014ancient Roman law redefined in a Christian context, Celtic tradition, and pre-Christian tradition.\n\n51.

According to linguists (\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6) there is nothing unusual about a single language dying out. But what is happening today is quite remarkable. According to the recent statistics, there are approximately 6,000 languages in the world as we speak. Of these, about half are going to die out in the next century. \n\nThere are several reasons as to why a language can eventually die out. These range from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, to sociological factors, like cultural assimilation, in which the culture of a minority group is gradually replaced by a stronger one. The former can cause tribes to leave their natural habitat(\u6816\u606f\u5730) and therefore become fewer and fewer in number. However, it doesn't happen very frequently. In fact, the latter is a much bigger threat and it is responsible for the extinction of a lot of languages in countries like the USA and Australia. For instance, Chemehuevi is one of the languages which is really close to dying out since its sole speaker is an old, yet healthy, man named Johnny Hill, Jr. \n\nIt is very important for as many languages as possible to be preserved. Scientists have been trying to raise people's awareness on how certain tribes have specific words which cannot be expressed in let's say English simply because there is no equal meaning. Namely, the Yupik of Alaska have 99 names to describe different layers of ice formation, or how the Tofa of Siberia classify reindeer (\u9a6f\u9e7f). In other words, when languages die out, mankind's wisdom reduces. \n\nOn a happier note, there are many famous cases which show what can be done to preserve languages in danger of extinction. In particular, the Maori in New Zealand have created so\u00adcalled \u201clanguage nests\u201d\uff1a organizations which help children under five learn the language. They provide them with a setting where they are exposed to the language intensively so that they get to realise that communicating in Maori is as natural as communicating in English. There is always, of course, the risk that the children won't keep the language alive after they have left their \u201cnests\u201d. Nevertheless, hope dies hard.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What most probably caused the death of languages in the USA and Australia?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:In Paragraph 3, the author states his opinion by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What does the author really intends to tell us in the last paragraph?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The author believes that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u653f\u6cbb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/wcchg303452394.html"},

He did this through the distribution of small gifts. With the help of his friends and neighbors, he distributed these small remembrances on a Saturday in October. During the years that followed, other Clevelanders began to participate in the celebration ceremony, which came to be called \u201cSweetest Day\u201d. In time, the Sweetest Day idea of spreading cheer to the underprivileged was broadened to include everyone, and became an occasion for remembering others with a kind act or a small remembrance. And soon the idea spread to other cities all over the country.\n\nSweetest Day is not based on any single group's religious affection or on a family relationship.

Thrill-seekers like me are in luck because theme parks are pushing the boundaries of technology to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known.\n\n Alton Towers in Britain opened the world's first 14-1oop roller coaster a few months ago, called The Smiler. Over in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest one. Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride sends out passengers from 0-240km/h in just 4. 9 seconds. During this rapid acceleration they experience G-forces only fighter pilots usually\u00a0 feel: Up to 4. 8G. The designer of several rides at Alton Towers, said: \"While we can stand 6-8Gs for very short periods of\u00a0 time, ff we experience 5G for more than five seconds we're likely to \"black out.\"\n\n On modern roller coasters passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops. But while we may have reached the limit in terms of G-forces, there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go---it's all down to money. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost ~18m to build.\n\n Some companies are finding other ways to keep us amused. There's a move towards indoor rides where the experience is improved by audio-visual technologies. For example, a company called Dynamic Structures is currently developing a \"coal-mine-themed\" ride for a client in Dubai that will combine speed and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics, which will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling.\n\n I can't wait to enjoy this one.

In order to answer this question, we must first examine whether people really want to preserve the historic feel of an area. Not all historical buildings are attractive. However, there may be other reasons for example, economic (\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684) reasons-why they should be preserved. So, let us assume that historical buildings are both attractive and important to the majority of people. What should we do then if a new building is needed?\n\nIn my view, new architectural styles can exist perfectly well alongside an older style. Indeed, there are many examples in my own home town of Tours where modern designs have been placed very successfully next to old buildings. As long as the building in question is pleasing and does not dominate (\u5f71\u54cd) its surroundings too much, it often improves the attractiveness of the area.\n\nIt is true that there are examples of new buildings which have spoilt (\u7834\u574f) the area they are in, but the same can be said of some old buildings too. Yet people still speak against new buildings in historic areas. I think this is simply because people are naturally conservative(\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684)and do not like change.\n\nAlthough we have to respect people's feelings as fellow users of the buildings, I believe that it is the duty of the architect and planner to \n\n.

However, he cannot take the credit for creating other well-loved characters, such as Cinderella and Snow White. \n\n are almost automatically associated with Disney because Disney turned old fables(\u5bd3\u8a00) into cartoon movies.\n\n The original Cinderella varies very much from the Disney version we know today. It started off with the girl mourning her mother's death and going to her tomb three times a day. In addition, there were only birds that helped Cinderella; there was no such thing as a fairy godmother or helpful mice, nor was there mention of a horse and carriage.\n\n The stepsisters were cruel: they always threw Cinderella's food into the ashes of the fire and made her sleep on the ashes on the floor, hence\uff08\u56e0\u6b64\uff09her name.\n\n In the original story, the king's ball actually lasted for three days. With the help of the birds, the girl, beautifully dressed, danced with the prince on all three nights and the prince fell in love with her. However, she broke away from him to rush back home each night. On the last night, the prince placed soothing sticky on the stairs; as Cinderella made her escape, a shoe got stuck on it.\n\nHere now is where the story becomes unpleasant: when the prince went to the house looking for the girl whose foot fit the shoe, the wicked(\u90aa\u6076\u7684) stepmother told one of her two daughters to cut off her big toe to fit into the shoe. The daughter did as told. So the prince took her away to be his bride. But when they passed the tomb of Cinderella's mother, the birds called out to the prince,\n\n\u201cTurn and peep, there's blood in the shoe;\n\nthe shoe is too small, the true bride waits for you.\u201d \n\nRealizing he had been tricked, the prince returned the daughter to her mother. The other then had to cut off part of her heel in order to fit into the shoe, with the same result. Only Cinderella's foot fit perfectly and so the prince chose to marry her. The story ends with the wedding day: as Cinderella's two stepsisters followed her, pretending to be devoted to her so that they could enjoy the king's riches, two birds flew by and plucked(\u5544) out their eyes. Because of their wickedness and falsehood, they had to spend the rest of their days blind.\n\nThe original Cinderella is so different from the Disney version.

At a height of almost 310 metres, it is the tallest building in Europe. The Shard has completely changed the appearance of London. However, not everyone thinks that it is a change for the better.\n\nThe Shard was designed by the famous Italian architect Renzo Piano. When he began designing the Shard for London, Piano wanted a very tall building that looked like a spire (\u5c16\u9876)\u2022 He wanted the glass surfaces to reflect the sky and the city. The sides of the building aren't regular. So the building has an unusual shape. It looks like a very thin\uff0csharp piece of broken glass. And that is how the building got the name: the Shard. Piano says that the spire shape of the Shard is part of a great London tradition. The shape reminds him of the spires of the churches of London or the tall masts (\u6845\u6746\uff09of the ships that were once on the river Thames.\n\nThe Shard has 87 floors. At the top, there is an observatory. At the moment the building is empty, but eventually there will be a five-star hotel. There will also be top quality restaurants, apartments and offices.\n\nBefore building work began, a lot of people didn't want the Shard though the plans were approved. Now they are still unhappy about the Shard. Some critics say that such a tall skyscraper might be good in a city like New York, but not in London. They say that the best thing about the Shard is its spire shape. But that is the only thing. There is no decoration, only flat surfaces. The Egyptians did that 4,500 years ago. They also think the Shard is too big for London. It destroys the beauty of the city.\n\nOther critics don't like what the Shard seems to represent. They say that the Shard shows how London is becoming more unequal. Only very rich people can afford to buy the expensive private apartments and stay in the hotel. But the people who live near the Shard are among the poorest in London. So the Shard seems a symbol of the division in society between the very rich and the poor.\n\nThe Shard now dominates the London skyline.

Some baboons were given the chance to watch another baboon who already knew how to solve the task, while others had to learn for themselves. To work out how brave or anxious the baboons were, Dr. Carter presented them either with a novel food or a threat in the form of a model of a poisonous snake.\n\nShe found that personality had a major impact on learning. The braver baboons learnt, but the shy ones did not learn the task although they watched the baboon perform the task of finding the novel food just as long as the brave ones did. In effect, despite being made aware of what to do, they were still too shy to do what the experienced baboon did.\n\nThe same held true for anxious baboons compared with calm ones.

When one of his employees started crying after a customer screamed at her, Travis took her away. \"Your working uniform is your shelter,\" he told her. \"Nothing anyone says will ever hurt you. You will always be as strong as you want to be.\"\n\nTravis picked up that lecture in one of his G\\&G training courses, an education program that began on his first day and continues throughout an employee's occupation. The training has, Travis says, changed his life. G\\&G has taught him how to live, how to focus, how to get to work on time, and how to master his emotions (\u60c5\u7eea). Most importantly, it taught him willpower.\n\nAt the center of that education is an extreme focus on an all-important habit; willpower. Dozens of cases show that willpower is the single most important habit for a person's success.\n\n And the best way to strengthen willpower is to make it into a habit. \"Sometimes it looks like people with great self-control aren't working hard\u2014but that's because they've made it automatic,\" Angela Duckworth, one of the University of Pennsylvania researchers said. \"Their willpower occurs without them having to think about it.\"\n\n The company spent millions of dollars developing programs of study to train employees on self-control.

They often stand close when talking and it is common for them to touch the person on the shoulder. People often greet each other (particularly women) with light cheek kisses. Schedules tend to be flexible, with business meetings sometimes starting later than planned. But to be safe, be on time. Meals can stretch for hours\u2014there's no such thing as rushing a meal in Brazil. Lunches also can start in the mid to late afternoon. Brazilians are social, preferring face-to-face communication over mails or phone calls.\n\nIn Singapore\n\nSingaporeans shake hands when they meet and often also greet each other with a small, polite bow. Business cards should be offered and received with two hands. Arriving late is considered disrespectful. So be on time. Efficiency(\u6548\u7387) is the goal, so meetings and dealings often are fast-paced. Singaporeans are direct in their discussions, even when the subject is about money. Rank is important and authority is respected. This determines both people interact in meetings. For example, people avoid disagreeing outright with someone with a higher rank.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates\n\nIn the UAE, status is important, so the most senior or oldest should be greeted first with their titles. The handshake seems to be longer than elsewhere. So, do not pull away the handshake. Women should cover themselves when it comes to dress. Men also tend to be covered from neck to elbows(\u8098\u90e8) and down to the knees. People do not avoid entertaining in their homes, but they also hold business meals at restaurants. Touching or passing food or eating with your left hand is to be avoided. When meetings are one-to-one, if your host offers you coffee, you should refuse. It might seem odd, but it is a cultural tradition. Coffee should only be accepted if it is always set out or presented.\n\nIn Switzerland\n\nThe Swiss tend to be formal and address each other by last name. They also are respectful of private lives. You should be careful not to ask about personal topics. Punctuality (\u5b88\u65f6) is vital, something that comes from a deep respect for others' time. Arrive at any meeting or event a few minutes early to be safe. They also have clear structure in their companies. Higher-ups make the final decisions, even if others might disagree. Neat, clean dress is expected. The Swiss follow formal table manners. They also keep their hands visible at the table and their elbows off the table.

Many experts have tried to make English easier for students to learn\u2015but they weren't always successful.\n\nIn 1930, Professor CK Ogden of Cambridge University invented Basic English. It had only 850 words (and just eighteen verbs) and Ogden said most people could learn it in just thirty hours. The problem was that people who learned Basic English could write and say simple messages, but they couldn't understand the answers in \u201creal\u201d English! It was also impossible to explain a word if it wasn't in the Basic English word list. For example, if you wanted a watermelon, you asked for \u201ca large green fruit with the form of an egg, which has a sweet red inside and a good taste\u201d! \n\nRE Zachrisson, a university professor in Sweden, decided that the biggest problem for learners of English was spelling, so he invented a language called Anglic. Anglic was similar to English, but with much simpler spelling. \u201cFather\u201d became \u201cfaadher\u201d, \u201cnew\u201d became \u201cnue' and \u201cyears\u201d became \u201cyeerz\u201d. Unfortunately for some students of English, Anglic never became popular.\n\nEven easier is the language which ships' captains use: it's called \u201cSeaspeak\u201d. Seaspeak uses a few simple phrases for every possible situation. In Seaspeak, for example, you don't say, \u201cI'm sorry what did you say?\u201d or \u201cI didn't understand, can you repeat that?\u201d It's just \u201cSay again.\u201d No more grammar!\n\nIn the age of international communication through the Internet who knows? ... a new form of English might appear.

And that has created a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one that's organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. \n\nConventionally grown food generally costs less, but is organic food a better choice? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and sold food products are now being debated on a large scale. Supporters of organic foods \u2015 a term whose meaning varies greatly \u2015are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. \n\nThe growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. \n\nAlmost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \u201cno-aging\u201d diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated(\u6ca1\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7684) reports that natural vitamins are superior to man-made ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than those treated with insect spray and the like. \n\nAlthough most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, large amounts of written material about the benefits of organic foods makes it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely advertised and form the basis for people's opinion. \n\nOne thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods. But in many cases consumers are misled if they believe organic foods can maintain health and provide better nutritional quality than conventionally grown foods. So there is real cause for concern if consumers, particularly those with limited incomes, distrust the conventional food supply and buy only expensive organic foods instead.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to Paragraph 2, which of the following statements about organic food is true?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:In Paragraph 4, treated grains are examples of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98983:It can be inferred from the passage that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:According to the passage, many consumers are attracted by organic foods because they \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:What is the author's attitude towards the claims of organic foods?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u653f\u6cbb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g2/201408/2nevg203455055.html"},

They are living together peacefully, although they share such different beliefs as Hindu, Roman Catholic, Muslim and so on.\u00a0\n\nThe country can be divided into many parts with different climates all because of its peculiar terrains (\u5730\u5f62).

The main big cities are Beau-Bassin and Mahebourg, with Port Louis as its capital. \n\nMauritius has many rare and unique animals, such as the snakes, parrots and lizards.

The Irish Gaelic people\u00a0 used descriptive nouns and adjectives which were meaningful.

Parents would choose names from the pool of existing names rather than invent new ones for their children.\n\nWith the rise of Christianity (\u57fa\u7763\u6559)\uff0c Christians were encouraged to name their children after the holy people of the church. These early Christian names can be found in many cultures today\uff0c in various forms. The pool of names in use in England changed basically after the Norman came in 1066. Then French names of Germanic origin became popular within three generations. As a result names like Emma\uff0c Matilda\uff0c Richard\uff0c and William\uff0c became common in English nomenclature. At the same time a few Old English names\uff0c like Edward and Alfred remained because they were names of holy people or kings\uff1b others were kept because they were used with slight changes by Germanic names from the Normans like Robert.\n\nSurnames developed from bynames\uff0c which are additional ones used to differentiate people with the same given name.\u00a0 These bynames fall into particular patterns.\u00a0 These started out as specific\u00a0 to a person and were taken down from father to son between the twelfth and sixteenth century.

Modern Land Art movement\n\n really got going in the 1960s, when American artists began creating Land Art on a large scale (\u89c4\u6a21).

It can be created by moving parts around. People can also add things to the environment to create Land Art, like salt, which is added to the Spiral Jetty. It \n\nis possible to use plants. In all cases, Land Art is immovable. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Land Art is designed to gradually form, change, and eventually decay (\u8870\u843d).

Bernard Sliver rose to the challenge and set out to study the problem, and began working on a solution involving an automatic way of keeping track of items that had been sold. Silver and a group of students from the institute realized their answer in the form of ultraviolet light (\u7d2b\u5916\u7ebf), ink and a scanner.\n\nThe system worked initially, but possessed some negatives. It was incredibly costly to carry out on a large scale and the system was also unstable. If the invention was to become commonplace (\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684\u4e8b) in grocery stores, these two problems had to be solved.\n\nThe patent (\u4e13\u5229)for the bar code system was filed by Sliver and one of his students, Woodland. The patent was not granted immediately; in fact it took three years for the patent agency to grand their invention patent for the barcode, occurring on 7\n\n October, 1952.\n\nDespite the patent being issued, the system was still not welcomed by the majority of store owners. It was not until 1966 that the system began moving its way into more and more grocery stores. This system was soon criticised, as there was no central mechanism for controlling uniformly coded items. In 1970, Logicorn developed the Universal Grocery Products Identification code (UGOIC), soon shortened to Universal Identification Number (UPC). It was Marsh's superstore, in Troy, which was the very first store to install this complex barcode reading system, and its popularity has soared (\u5347\u6e29) ever since, and is obviously now commonplace in all types of stores worldwide.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is stressed in the second paragraph?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which of the following was NOT a drawback of Silver's system?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What is the purpose of the text?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u5316\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/bjc9g303423265.html"},

About three miles outside Newport we were watching for deer jumping across the road. Suddenly, there was a large rock in our path. I hit the brakes and we went into a ditch(\u58d5\u6c9f).\n\n\u201cAs I applied the brakes, both my wife and I threw our hands up to keep our daughter from hitting the car. There was soft mud in the ditch, so the car wasn't damaged, and no one was hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the ride home I couldn't stop thinking about the accident. I asked myself,\u2018Why couldn't some object come out to stop you from striking the inside of the car?'As soon as I got home that night I drew some sketches(\u8349\u56fe). Each evening for the following two weeks, I'd add or reduce something from the sketches.\u201d\n\nHetrick applied an event he had observed while in the Navy to the design of the air bag. He was repairing a torpedo(\u9c7c\u96f7) which had a cloth covering. When the compressed\uff08\u538b\u7f29\u7684\uff09 air that was in the torpedo was let out, the covering was suddenly filled with air and was shot to the ceiling.\n\nWith this knowledge, he developed his design until he was able to obtain a patent on the invention on August 5, 1952. The idea was similar to the air bag designs of today. Compressed air is stored in a container and when a traffic accident occurs and the car slows down at a rapid enough rate, the air will be released into the air bag. The idea was \n\n, but Hetrick's air bag never would have functioned properly.

Her husband also climbed up the tree and tried to catch her, but the woman jumped and the man followed. The vines saved her life, but her husband died.\n\nThis ancient custom caught the interest of some students at Oxford University in England. In the late 1970s, they formed a group called the Dangerous Sports Club. They were some of the first people to test several of what are now called extreme sports. They are said to have invented modern bungee jumping.\n\nIn the spring of 1979, members of the group jumped off the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, England. They were attached to the bridge by a bungee cord, a long elastic rope that stretches. The group soon received even more attention when they organized a bungee jump off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California.\n\nA man named A. J. Hackett of New Zealand decided to make the sport into a business. He started developing bungee ropes and material with a friend. They held a major jump in 1987 off the famous Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. They later got permission to open the first bungee jumping operation on the Kawarau Bridge in Queenstown, New Zealand.

Around 1870, it was experiencing an economic(\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684)boom, and the capital, Buenos Aires, attracted many people. Farmers, as well as a flood of foreigners from Spain and Italy, came to Buenos Aires seeking jobs. These jobs didn\u2032t pay well, and the people felt lonely and disappointed with their new life in the city. As the unhappy newcomers mixed together in the poor parts of the city, the dance known an the tango(\u63a2\u6208\u821e)came into being\n\n At the beginning the tango was a dance of the lower classes. It was danced in the bars and streets. At that time there many fewer women than men, so if a man didn\u2032t want to be left out, his only choice was to dance with another man so that he could attract the attention of the few available women.

It is possible that it grew out of the discovery that some people did certain kinds of work better than others did them. That led to the concept of specialization, which means that people would specialize, or focus, on doing one specific job.\n\n Let's take a man we'll call Mr. Fielder, for example. He did everything connected with farming. He planted seeds, tended the fields, and harvested and sold his crops. At the same time, he did many other jobs on the farm. However, he didn't make the bricks for his house, grind the wheat for his flour, or cut his trees into boards. He also did not make the plows(\u7281), the work boots, or any of the other hundreds of things a farm needs. Instead, he got them from people who specialized in doing each of those things.\n\n Suppose there was another man we shall call Mr. Plowright. Using what he knew about farming and working with iron, Mr. Plowright invented a plow that made farming easier. Mr. Plowright did not really like farming himself and wanted to specialize in making really good\u00a0 plows. Perhaps, he thought, other farmers will trade what they grow for one of my plows.\n\n How did Mr. Plowright let people know what he was doing? Why, he advertised, of course. First he opened a shop and then he put up a sign outside the shop to attract customers. That sign may have been no more than a plow carved into a piece of wood and a simple arrow pointing to the shop door. It was probably all the information people needed to find Mr. Plowright and his really good plows.\n\n Many historians believe that the first outdoor signs were used about five thousand years ago. Even before most people could read, they understood such signs. Shopkeepers would carve into stone, clay, or wood symbols for the products they had for sale.\n\n A medium, in advertising talk, is the way you communicate your message. You might say that the first medium used in advertising was signs with symbols. The second medium was audio, or sound, although that term is not used exactly in the way we use it today. Originally, just the human voice and maybe some kind of simple instrument, such as a bell, were used to get people's attention.\n\nA crier, in the historical sense, is not someone who weeps easily. It is someone, probably a man, with a voice loud enough to be heard over the other noises of a city. In ancient Egypt, shopkeepers might hire such a person to spread the news about their products.

We may not depend so much on wild animals now. But we hear about them every day. Americans use the names of animals in many ways. Automobile manufacturers (\u5236\u9020\u5546) and gasoline companies especially like to use big cats to sell their products. They like lions, tigers and wildcats. When Americans say wildcat, they usually mean \n\n. All these cats attack quickly and fiercely. So wildcats represent something fast and fierce.\n\nAn early American use of the word wildcat was quite different. It was used to describe members of Congress who declared war on Britain in 1812. A magazine of that year said the wildcat congressmen went home. It said they were unable to face the responsibility of having involved their country in an unnecessary war.\n\nWildcat also has been used as a name for money. At that time, some states permitted banks to make their own money. One bank in the state of Michigan offered paper money with a picture of a wildcat on it. Some banks, however, did not have enough gold to support all the paper money they offered. So the money had little or no value. It was called a wildcat bill or a wildcat bank note.\n\nThe banks which offered this money were called wildcat banks. A newspaper of the time said those were the days of wildcat money. It said a man might be rich in the morning and poor by night.\n\nWildcat then was used for an oil well or gold mine that had almost no oil or gold in it. Dishonest developers would buy such property. Then they would sell it and leave town with the money. The buyers were left with worthless holes in the ground. Today, wildcat oil wells are in areas that are not known to have oil.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the main idea of the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:From the passage we can know that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The underlined words \u201ca lynx, an ocelot or a bobcat\u201din Paragraph 1 may refer to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:It can be inferred that during the days of wildcat money \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u5316\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g2/201408/2m7kg203429402.html"},

Between 1815 and 1914, the world witnessed the greatest peaceful migration in its history: 35 million people, mostly Europeans, left their homelands to start new lives in America. Why did these people risk everything by leaving their homes and families?\n\nFirst, what forced emigrants to make the decision to leave? One major cause for European farmers to leave was the rise in population which in turn led to land hunger. Another was politics. There was an increased taxation\uff08\u7a0e\u6536\uff09 and the growth of armies, and many young men fled eastern Europe to avoid being forced to join the army.\n\nPhysical hunger provided another pressing reason. Following the collapse \uff08\u8870\u9000\uff09of the economy of southern Italy in the 1860s, hundreds of thousands decided to start a new life in America. Religion also encouraged millions to leave the Old World.\n\nIn short, people chose to leave their homes for social, economic and religious reasons. As a result, by 1890 among a total population of 63 million, there were more than nine million foreign-born Americans.\n\nBut what were the attractions? First of all, there was the promise of land which was so scarce in Europe. Next, factories were calling for workers, and pay conditions were much better than back home. Men were needed to open up the West and build the long railroads, and new towns needed settlers to live in and to develop business. There was the space for religious people to practice their faith in peace.\n\nThis immigration meant that by around the 1850s Americans of non-English had started to be more than those of English. As we know, there were losers. To start with, there were those unwilling immigrants, the slaves who had been used as a source of cheap labour. Nor should we forget the equally unlucky American Indians. By 1860 there were 27 million free whites, four million slaves and a mere 488,000 free blacks.\n\nNowadays, the USA is still seen by millions as the Promised Land. As always, it remains an attractive place to those who think it will offer them a second chance.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is not the cause for people to leave their homeland? \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why was life of the 19th Century European farmers difficult?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983: Which of the following was not an attraction of the USA?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is the topic of this passage? \n\n\u5c0f\u98985: The American Indians \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u5316\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/p96hg303430387.html"},

Jehan lived the rest of his days, eight years, imprisoned not far from the Taj Mahal. Jehan was only allowed to climb onto the top of his prison to see the timeless treasure from a distance. But never again would he be allowed to visit it until he was buried next to his wife.\n\n Today 25,000 people visit the Taj Mahal each day.

The problems started in the 16th century when English ruler tried to conquer Ireland. For hundreds of years, the Irish people fought against the English, Finally, in 1921, the British government was forced to give independence to the south of Ireland. The result is that today there are two \"Irelands\". Northern Ireland, in the north, is part of the United Kingdom. The Republic of Ireland, in the south, is an independent country.\n\nIn the 1840s the main crop, potatoes, was affected by disease and about 750,000 people died of hunger. This, and a shortage (\u77ed\u7f3a) of work, forced many people to leave Ireland and live in the USA, the UK, Australia and Canada. As a result of these problems, the population fell from 8.2 million in 1841 to 6.6 million in 1851.\n\nFor many years, the majority of Irish people earned their living as farmers. Today, many people will work on the land but more and more people are moving to the cities to work in factories and offices.

They often refer to something being \u201cas American as baseball and apple pie\u201d. But is baseball really an American sport? And what are origins of baseball anyway?\n\nThe American game of baseball more than likely came from several European ball games. Russia had an early form of baseball and so did Germany and Romania. People in England played a game called \u201cstool ball\u201d. In this game, the pitcher(\u6295\u624b)tried to hit a stool(\u51f3\u5b50)or chair with a ball and the batter(\u51fb\u7403\u624b)used a stick to keep the ball away. But American baseball was most likely based on another English game, which is called \u201crounders\u201d. Players use a soft ball rater than a hard ball while playing rounders.\n\nSo when was the first real game of \u201cbaseball\u201d played? It seems that it took place in the 1840s. The father of baseball was Alexander Cartwright, who organized a baseball club in New York. Cartwright developed 20 rules that distinguished baseball from previous ball games.\n\nIn 1858, the first organized baseball league\u2014the National Association of Baseball players\u2014was formed. This league began charging fans to watch the games. However, the players were all amateurs and did not get paid . In 1869, the Cincinnati Red Stockings began to pay their players. Since they could hire the best players, Cincinnati won 57 games and lost none in their first season. As a result, other teams decided to hire players too. By 1871, the National Association was the first professional baseball league.\n\nToday baseball is liked very much in America. Top professional baseball players earn millions of dollars each year. There are two professional leagues\u2014the National League and the American League. The best teams from these two leagues compete for the baseball championship every year.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:81.What do Americans think of baseball? (No more than 3 words)2'\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:82.

His wife was a beautiful and bright woman whom he loved greatly. Her title was Mumtazl Mahal: its shortened form Taj Mahal, means \u201cpride of the palace\u201d. In the year 1630 this beloved wife of the emperor died. He was so brokenhearted that he thought of giving up his throne. He decided out of his love for his wife, to build her the most beautiful tomb that had ever been seen.\n\nHe summoned the best artists and architects from India, Turkey, Persia and Arabia and finally, the design was complete. It took more than twenty thousand men working over a period of 18 years to build the Taj Mahal, one of the most beautiful buildings in the world.\n\nThe building itself stands on a marble platform 29 meters square and 6-7 meters high. Towers rise from each of the four corners. The Mahal itself soars another 61 meters into the air. It is an eight-sided building made of white marble.\n\nThe emperor planned to build an identical tomb of black marble for himself on the other side of the river connected by a silver bridge.

The problems started in the 16th century when English rulers tried to conquer(\u5f81\u670d) Ireland. For hundreds of years, the Irish people fought against the English.

Northern Ireland, in the north, is part of the united kingdom. The Republic of Ireland, in the south, is an independent country. \n\nIn the 1840s the main crop, potatoes, was affected by disease and about 750,000 people died of hunger. This, and a shortage (\u77ed\u7f3a) of work , forced many people to leave Ireland and live in the USA, the UK, Australia and Canada. As a result of these problems, the population fell from 8.2 million in 1841 to 6.6 million in 1851.\n\nFor many years, the majority of Irish people earned their living as farmers. Today, many people still work on the land but more and more people are moving to the cities to work in factories and offices. Life in the cities is very different from life in the countryside, where things move at a quieter and slower pace.\n\nThe Irish are famous for being warm-hearted and friendly.

It said they were unable to face the responsibility of having involved their country in an unnecessary war.\n\n Wildcat also has been used as a name for money in the 1800s. At that time, some states permitted banks to make their own money. One bank in the state of Michigan offered paper money with a picture of a wildcat on it. Some banks, however, did not have enough gold to support all the paper money they offered. So the money had little or no value. It was called a wildcat bill or a wildcat banknote. The banks who offered this money were called wildcat banks. A newspaper of the time said those were the days of wildcat money. It said a man might be rich in the morning and poor by night.\n\n Wildcat then was also used for an oil well or gold mine that had almost no oil or gold in it. Dishonest developers would buy such property. Then they would sell it and leave town with the money. The buyers were left with worthless holes in the ground.

Countries also use animals as symbols. From eagles to lions, many countries use an animal to show its national spirit and character.\n\nThe image of an eagle is on the US President's flag, and on the one-dollar bill. The bald eagle is a large, powerful, brown bird with a white head and tail. The term \u201cbald\u201d does not mean that this bird lacks feathers. Instead, it comes from the old word piebald, that menas, \u201cmarked with white\u201d.\n\nThe US declared that the eagle was its national bird in 1782. It was chosen because of \u201cits long life, great strength, and noble looks\u201d.\n\nA few eagles have even become American heroes. An eagle named \u201cOld Abe\u201d, the mascot of a Wisconsin troop of soldiers during the Civil War, traveled 14,000 miles with its men. He was often shot at by the enemy, but survived 42 battles.\n\nBut, one of the Founding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin didn't agree with the choice. \u201cThe bald eagle \u2026 is a bird of bad moral character, like those among men who live by robbing, he is generally poor, and often very messy,\u201d he argued.

He was the first English King to use a lion as a royal symbol, which is popularly known as the \u201cking of the jungle\u201d. By the year Richard \u2160, known as \u201cThe Lionheart\u201d for his bravery, came to the throne in 1189, the famous Three Lions badge had been formed.

But for about 90 percent of chocolate's long history, it was strictly a beverage (\u996e\u6599), and sugar didn't have anything to do with it.\n\nThe Origin of Chocolate \n\nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older. \n\nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe prove that the earliest linguistic (\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7684) evidence of chocolate consumption dates back three or even four thousand years.\n\nValuable and Fashionable Chocolate Beverage \n\nIt's hard to discover exactly when chocolate was born, but it's clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\n\nSweetened chocolate didn't appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled (\u54c1\u5c1d) the native cuisine. Chocolate didn't suit the foreigners' taste at first \u2014 one described it in his writings as \u201ca bitter drink for pigs\u201d \u2014 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal functions. But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s.\n\nThe Birth of Solid Chocolate\n\nIn 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate. His product became known as \u201cDutch cocoa\u201d, and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. In 1847, Joseph Fry created the first modern chocolate bar. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later.\n\nProsperous Chocolate Industry \n\nIn America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was used instead of wages. Even now, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force. Chocolate manufacturing is a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and the average American eats at least half a pound of the stuff per month.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The earliest chocolate was most probably \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:\u00a0It can be inferred from the passage that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Why did chocolate suit the Spanish's taste so quickly? \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which one shows the correct order according to the time of their appearing? \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u5316\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/z56vg303443999.html"},

It is best known for being a federal prison, which was also called \u201cThe Rock.\u201d It was once the most famous prison in America. \n\nAlcatraz was a military prison from the late eighteen fifties until the nineteen thirties. Then it became a federal prison for the country's worst criminals. These included murderers, bank robbers and kidnappers. One of the main reasons federal officials chose Alcatraz Island to detain these prisoners was because they thought it would be impossible for prisoners to escape.\n\nCold, deep and dangerous waters surround the island. Also, the distance between the island and San Francisco is too far for most humans to swim. No prisoner was ever officially reported to have successfully escaped.\n\nHowever, in nineteen sixty-two, three men broke out of the prison. Each man worked very hard at night for many months to cut through the stone wall of his cell. They made false heads out of paper, paint and hair. On the night of June eleventh, the men placed the heads in their beds to make it look as if they were sleeping. Then, the prisoners escaped through the holes in their cells to get to the water. The men were never seen or heard from again. It is believed that they drowned while trying to swim to San Francisco.\n\nThe prison closed in nineteen sixty-three because of the high cost of keeping prisoners there and the need for major repairs. The last prisoners were moved to other jails. \n\nIn nineteen seventy-two, the United States Congress passed a bill creating the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Alcatraz Island and the old prison are part of this area.\n\nEach year, more than one million people visit Alcatraz to see the prisoners' cells and listen to stories about the jail's history.

They have stood for nearly 5, 000 years, and it seems likely that they will continue to stand for thousands of years yet. There are over eighty of them scattered(\u6563\u5e03)along the banks of the Nile, some of which are different in shape from the true pyramids. The most famous of these are the \u201cStep\u201d pyramid and the \u201cBent\u201d pyramid. \n\n\u3000\u3000Some of the pyramids still look as much alike as they must have been when they were built thousands of years ago. Most of the damage suffered by the others has been at the hands of men who were looking for treasure or, more often, for stones to use in modern buildings. The dry climate of Egypt has helped to keep the pyramids in good condition, and their very shape has made them less likely to fall into ruin. These are good reasons why they can still be seen today, but perhaps the most important is that they were planned to last forever. \n\n\u3000\u3000The \u201cStep\u201d pyramid had to be on the west side of the Nile, the side on which the sun sets. This was for spiritual reasons. It also had to stand well above the level of the river to protect it against the regular floods. It could not be too far from the Nile, however, as the stones to build it needed to be carried in boats down the river to the nearest point. Water transport was, of course, much easier than land transport. The builders also had to find a rock base, which was not likely to crack(\u7834\u88c2)under the great weight of the pyramid.

On television there are many more detective and murderers than exist in the real world. A rule of thumb about violence is \u201cIf it bleeds, it leads.\u201d Violence captures viewers' attention. Our programs have become increasing violent.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:\n\nSome might say that there is nothing new under the sun. Of course, in a narrow sense, they are correct. There have always been murderers, and stories about violence have been the theme of literature and song. However, things are different now. Children are exposed to hundreds of examples of violence every day. The frequency and intensity of these images is unprecedented in the history of humanity. We have clear records that this exposure makes it more likely that children will be violent and increase their fear levels about potential violence.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u504f\u6613,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g1/201408/6rh9g103382164.html"},

If you drop that into a piggy bank and then once a year put \\$1,434 in a savings account at 1% interest rate after-tax, you will have your trip money.\n\n When I was a child, my parents gave me a piggy bank to teach me that, if I wanted something, I should save money to buy it. We associate piggy banks with children, but in many countries, the little containers are also popular with adults. Europeans see a piggy bank as a sign of good fortune and wealth. Around the world, many believe a gift of a piggy bank on New Year's Day brings good luck and financial success. Ah, but you have to put\u00a0\n\n\u00a0in it.\n\n Why is a pig used as a symbol of saving? Why not an elephant bank, which is bigger and holds more coins? In the Middle Ages, before modern banking and credit instruments, people saved money at home, a few coins at a time dropped into a jar or dish. Potters(\u5236\u9676\u5de5) made these inexpensive containers from an orange-colored clay(\u9ecf\u571f) called \u201cpygg,\u201d and folks saved coins in pygg jars.The Middle English word\n\nfor pig was \u201cpigge\u201d. While the Saxons pronounced pygg, referring to the clay, as \u201cpug\u201d, eventually the two words changed into the same pronunciation, sounding the \u201ci\u201d as in pig or piggy. As the word became less associated with the orange clay and more with the animal, a clever potter fashioned a pygg jar in the shape of a pig, delighting children and adults. The piggy bank was born.\n\n Originally you had to break the bank to get to the money, bringing in a sense of seriousness into savings. While piggy banks teach children the wisdom of saving, adults often need to relearn childhood lessons. Think about the things in life that require large amounts of money--- college education, weddings, cars, medical care, starting a business, buying a home, and fun stuff like great trips. So when you have money, take off the top 10%, put it aside, save and invest wisely.\u00a0\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the piggy bank strategy?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why did the writer's parents give him a piggy bank as a gift?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What does then underlined word \u201csomething\u201d(Paragraph 3) most probably refer to?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The piggy ban originally was \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The last paragraph talks about \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g0/201408/esong003454101.html"},

That morning, my 11-year-old had stomach pains, retching\uff08\u5e72\u5455\uff09into a bowl. Talking to other mothers later, I heard about other children with stomachache or difficult sleeping the night before.\n\n What caused so much pain? Sports day. Sports day might be necessary at a highly-competitive independent school, but not at a village primary school. For the children who can fly like the wind, sports day cause no problem. For those who are overweight or just not good at sport, it is nightmare\uff08\u5669\u68a6\uff09. Even for those who enjoy running but fall halfway down the track in front of the entire school and their parents, it can prove a disease.\n\n Why do we put our children through this annual suffering? Some may say competition is character building; or it's taking part, not winning, that's important; or that's a tradition of school life. I just felt great pity for those children in tears or in pain.\n\n Team games at the end of sports day produced some close races, wild enthusiasm, lots of shouting \u2014 and were fun to watch. More importantly, the children who were not so fast or quick at passing the ball were hidden a little from everyone's eyes. Some of them also had the thrill of being on the winning side.\n\n I wish that sports day could be abandoned and replaced with some other less competitive event.

Most of the parts of your body still work great, you have a full head of hair, you're energetic, and you have a world of opportunity in front of you. However, there's going to come a time when you start to get older. And as you get older, you'll have new responsibilities, complete independence, and perhaps most importantly, less time to recover from mistakes.\n\nYou see, we all make mistakes in life. Maybe you spent more money than you should have on a car, you passed up on a great job opportunity, or you didn't try as hard as you could have in school. It's a part of life and we learn from it. But there are certain mistakes that are much better made while you're still young and have plenty of time to recover.\n\nI'm definitely not telling you that you should purposely go out and make these mistakes (because they're a pain to recover from). But these are all mistakes that are much better made when you're younger so that you can learn from them and not have them ruin your entire life.\n\nStarting the wrong career\n\nWouldn't you hate to be 45 years old and discover that you absolutely hate what you do for a living? It's a reality that a lot of people face and it can be difficult to fix. You see, when you're 23 and find out you don't like the career path you've chosen, you can easily explore new career options.\n\nWe no longer live in an age when people are expected to stay with one company until they retire. You can bounce around a little bit and find out what you want to do. When you get older, just switching careers whenever you want isn't as simple.\n\nYou have to consider your family, retirement, the difficulties you might run into with starting from the bottom in a new industry, and plenty of other issues that someone in their early 20's just doesn't have to deal with.\n\nDating the wrong person\n\nThe divorce rate in the U.S is extremely high. Other parts of the world aren't doing too much better either. While everyone gets divorced for their own reasons, I think we can all agree that it's better to find out that the person you're with is wrong for you sooner rather than later.\n\nHopefully you find out whether or not the person you're with is right for you before you tie the knot, because around 50% of first marriages end in divorce.\n\nMessing up your credit\n\nRuining your credit is never a good idea. Even if you ruin it while you're young, it could affect you in the future. The upside of having bad credit while you're young instead of older is that you have time to build it back up.\n\nIt can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy. During those 7-10 years, you'll have a hard time financing anything unless you have a cosigner or put down a substantial down payment.\n\nMost people tend to make most of the bigger purchases in life when they get older such as a house or their dream car. If you have bad credit, you can kiss all of that goodbye.\n\nMaking bad investments\n\nIf you're investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you'll be working your entire life. Whether you choose to pay someone to do the investing for you or handle it all yourself, it's a lot better to take risks when you're younger.\n\nIf you invest in stock or even real estate while you're young and the market takes a hit, you're not ruined. Investing is a long-term venture, so the younger you start, the more fluctuation you can withstand and still come out with a positive return.\n\nBlowing your money\n\nWhat would you do if you went broke at 60 years old? You would be working your behind off when you really should be relaxing and getting ready to retire soon.\n\nBut if you're 25 and broke, you still have plenty of time to earn more money. Also, nobody will judge you because it's not unusual for people in their 20's to not have money these days. You might have blown your money on a nice car or have an obsession with all the newest gadgets. \n\nWhen you get older, you'll be able to look back and realize how dumb you were for spending \\$20,000 on a brand new car when you were only 20 years old. But when you're older and waste your money, you'll REALLY have nothing to show for it.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The following are all the advantages of being young EXCEPT \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:You can bounce around a little bit and find out what you want to do. \u201cBounce\u201d in this sentence is most similar in meaning to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983: What does the author really mean by saying \u201cit's a lot better to take risks when you're younger\u201d?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:We can infer from the passage that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The author wrote this article mainly to tell the young \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/4q6wg303454215.html"},

But it's not just the 26 miles and 385 yards that could be a daunting prospect. \u201cI have to admit to being completely frustrated by the blocking and for 18-19 miles was just keeping away from people and being held up,\u201d one participant grumbled after the 2012 London Marathon. \u201cI had to overtake a lot of people and ended up with bruised\uff08\u6de4\u80bf\u7684\uff09forearms from all the elbows,\u201d said another.\n\nHow do such crowding problems arise, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear \u2013 road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser(\u6d53\u7a20). At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there's a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply.\n\nTreiber's model of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d(\u627f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b)at each point on the route.\n\nThis allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions \u2013 for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves.\n\nTreiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided \u2013 and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers consulted Treiber's team, and eventually chose this option.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the worst thing while running a marathon?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which of the following statements is true?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What is NOT true about the Rennsteig?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What's the main idea of the passage?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u504f\u6613,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/j9wzg303454367.html"},

But it doesn't come from Hollywood\u2014it's Hallyu(\u97e9\u6d41), the wave of Korean pop culture that has washed over Asia. It has influenced everything from music to television. And thanks to the Internet and social media, it's now spreading worldwide.\n\nSouth Korea produces all types of entertainment, the most popular being music, soap operas and films. What makes Hallyu so hot in Asia? One reason is that its products are of high quality and much cheaper than western products. Another reason is that eastern cultures are similar to each other, although there are language differences.\n\nKorean pop music, or \u201cK-pop\u201d, ranks the first\u00a0everywhere. Fans love the songs and the attractive stars. Companies like SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment help many K-pop stars, such as Super Junior, Big Bang and Rain, to succeed. They are not only popular in Asia but also enjoy popularity in the West. In 2011, Big Bang's mini-album Tonight reached the top 10 on U.S. Tunes Top Pop Albums. When SM Entertainment took their 2010 world tour to Los Angeles, only 30 percent of the 15,000 fans were Korean. Half of the audience wasn't even Asian!\n\nOne important reason for the success of Hallyu is simply the Internet. A little more than 10 years ago, Korean soap operas, movies and music reached the outside world quite slowly. They began in Korea, and then gradually spread outward, appearing in its neighboring countries where local TV and radio companies would play them. Now they are played around the world online at the same time.\n\nYouTube is another major way to get Korean entertainment to fans everywhere. It is an inexpensive and \n\n way for artists to introduce their work to a larger audience.

These cards are more secure than the traditional magnetic-strip version and can be used to travel on buses, check bank accounts and do shopping.\n\nThe Manchester project is one of the biggest smart card schemes in the world. Every time people use the cards on a bus or train, the fare is deducted (reduced) from the value of the card. When they have no credit left, the cards can be recharged at a local shop.\n\nA smart card looks just like a normal plastic card but it has a silicon chip in it. It is possible for the same silicon chip to perform a number of different functions, so one plastic card in your pocket could do a large number of different jobs. The card has much more memory space than a magnetic-strip card, so many more things can be recorded on it.There are two types of smart cards. One is the contact card which is used in the same way as a magnetic-strip card.\n\nInformation is transferred by running the card through a narrow opening in an electronic reader. In the slot, electronic probes make contact with the magnetic-strip or silicon ship and read the information. The other type is the contactless smart card where the electronic reader communicates with the card by short-range radio waves. This makes the card quicker and more convenient to use because it does not have to leave your wallet.\u00a0 It is also more reliable as it is not easily influenced by scratches or dirt. However, the biggest advantage that smart cards have over magnetic-strip cards is that they are more secure. They are much more difficult to make than conventional cards and they have to be made by specially trained manufacturers. In addition, they have a large number of extra security features on them and if a smart card gets lost or stolen a quick phone-call to the distributor ensures that its individual number is made invalid and unreadable.

She got out to open a metal gate that blocked her path .That's when she heard the whistle sounded by the driver of a train. Her Renault Clio was parked across a railway line. Seconds later, she watched the train drag her car almost a kilometre down the railway tracks.\n\nCeely's \n\nmade the news because she blamed it on her GPS (\u5bfc\u822a\u4eea). She had never driven the route before. It was dark and raining heavily. Ceely was relying on her GPS, but it made no mention of the crossing. \u201cI put my complete trust in the device and it led me right into the path of a speeding train,\u201d she told the BBC.\n\nWho is to blame here? Rick Stevenson, who tells Ceely's story in his book When Machines Fail Us, points the finger at the limitations of technology. We put our faith in digital devices, he says, but our digital helpers are too often not up to the job. They are filled with small problems. And it's not just GPS devices: Stevenson takes us on a tour of digital disasters involving everything from mobile phones to wireless keyboards.\n\nThe problem with his argument in the book is that it's not clear why he only focuses on digital technology, while there may be a number of other possible causes. A map-maker might have left the crossing off a paper map. Maybe we should blame Ceely for not paying attention. Perhaps the railway authorities are at fault for poor singalling system. Or maybe someone has studied the relative dangers and worked out that there really is something specific wrong with the GPS equipment. But Stevenson doesn't say.\n\nIt's a problem that runs through the book. In a section on cars, Stevenson gives an account of the advanced techniques that criminals use to defeat computer-based locking systems for cars. He offers two independent sets of figures on car theft; both show a small rise in some parts of the country. He says that once again not all new locks have proved reliable. Perhaps, but maybe it's also due to the shortage of policemen on the streets. Or changing social circumstances. Or some combination of these factors.\n\nThe game between humans and their smart devices is amusing and complex. It is shaped by economics and psychology and the cultures we live in. Somewhere in the mix of those forces there may be a way for a wiser use of technology.\n\nIf there is such a way, it should involve more than just an awareness of the shortcomings of our machines.

But the trouble is that it only makes you want to eat more. You might sweat out a couple of pounds playing tennis or climbing a mountain, but you put it all back on again with a big steak or bread and jam.\n\nA helpful way is food choosing. But what sort of food should you choose? Some believe that the less they eat, the slimmer they will be. They don't eat anything until they become weak with hunger. Some stick to milk and bananas. You'll find you need a lot of bananas, and unless you live where they grow, they aren't cheap. Another says that if you eat things like hard-boiled eggs, and apples with their skins on which are hard for your stomach to digest (\u6d88\u5316), the more you eat, the thinner you get. This is because you use up the fat in your body to get the energy to digest the food.\n\nFor most of us these methods are too extreme (\u6781\u7aef\u7684).

Both men have hearing damage from exposure to loud music, and both now wear hearing aids as a consequence. As a teenager, Clinton played saxophone in a band. Townshend, who has the more severe hearing loss, was a guitarist for a band called the Who. He is one of the first rock musicians to call the public's attention to the problem of hearing loss from exposure to loud music.\n\n Temporary hearing loss can happen after only 15 minutes of listening to loud music. One early warning sign is when your ears begin to feel warm while you listen to music at a rock concert or through headphones. One later is that an unusual sound or a ringing is sometimes produced in your head after the concert.\n\n \"What happens is that the hair cells in the inner ear are damaged, but they're not dead,\" says physician and ear specialist Dr. Sam Levine. According to Dr. Levine, if you avoid further exposure to loud noise, it's possible to \n\n the cells somewhat. However, he adds, \"Eventually, over a long period of time, hair cells are permanently damaged.\" And this is no small problem.\n\n What sound level is dangerous? According to Dr. Levine, regular exposure to noise above 85 decibels (\u5206\u8d1d) is considered dangerous. The chart below offers a comparison of decibel levels to certain sounds. Here's another measurement you can use. If you're at a rock concert and the music is so loud that you have to shout to make yourself heard, you' re at risk for hearing loss. That's when wearing protective devices such as earplugs becomes critical.\n\n The facts are pretty frightening. But are rock bands turning down the volume.'? Most aren't. \"Rock music is supposed to be loud,\" says drummer Andrew Sather.\u00a0 \"I wouldn't have it any other way. And neither would the real fans of rock. \"\n\nContinued exposure to loud music and the failure to wear earplugs can lead to deafness, according to Dr. Levine. He states, \"There's no cure for hearing loss. Your ears are trying to tell you something. That ringing is the scream of your hair cells dying. Each time that happens, more and more damage is done. \"\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:From Paragraph 1, we can learn that \n\n.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:In Paragraph 3, the underlined word \"recondition\" means \n\n.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The purpose of the chart at the end of the article is to show \n\n.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following statements will Dr. Sam Levine probably agree?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u5065\u5eb7\u73af\u4fdd\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/ualug303447612.html"},

The document says that deaths around the world from malaria and tuberculosis could be cut in half by the year 2010. It also says the number of deaths from AIDS could be reduced 25 percent within that same time period.\n\n The report is called \u201cCalling Up the Response to Infectious Diseases.\u201d It calls for huge new investments in methods to prevent and treat infectious diseases. Officials say money is needed for research and to purchase drugs. Money is also needed to devices to prevent diseases, such as bed nets. Bed nets prevent mosquitoes that carry malaria from biting people while they sleep.\n\n David Heymann, director of the infectious disease program at the World Health Organization, says that providing effective drug treatments is important for improving peoples' health and economic well \u2013 being. Reducing disease can also help improve economic growth in developing countries.\n\n The WHO report also describes successful health programs in developing countries. In Peru, for example, the number of tuberculosis cases was cut in half by increasing the treatment to control the disease. In Vietnam, malaria was reduced 97 percent through the use of bed nets. And in Uganda, cases of the virus that causes AIDS were cut in half among pregnant women and children through the use of anti \u2013 AIDS drugs.\n\n This new international health campaign is estimated to cost about 12,000 million dollars a year.

We may speak contemptuously of the poor old Romans because they relished the orgies of slaughter that went on in their arenas. We may despise them because they mistook these goings on for entertainment. We may forgive them condescendingly because they lived 2000 years ago and obviously knew no better. But are our feelings of superiority really justified? Are we any less blood-thirsty? Why do boxing matches, for instance, attract such universal interest? Don't the spectators who attend them hope they will see some violence? Human beings remains as bloodthirsty as ever they were. The only difference between ourselves and the Romans is that while they were honest enough to admit that they enjoyed watching hungey lions tearing people apart and eating them alive, we find all sorts of sophisticated arguments to defend sports which should have been banned long age; sports which are quite as barbarous as, say, public hangings or bearbaiting.\n\nIt really is incredible that in this day and age we should still allow hunting or bull-fighting, that we should be prepared to sit back and watch two men batter each other to pulp in a boxing ring, that we should be relatively unmoved by the sight of one or a number of racing cars crashing and bursting into flames. Let us not deceive ourselves. Any talk of \u2018the sporting spirit' is sheer hypocrisy. People take part in violent sports because of the high rewards they bring. Spectators are willing to pay vast sums of money to see violence. A world heavyweight championship match, for instance, is front page news. Millions of people are disappointed if a big fight is over in two rounds instead of fifteen. They feel disappointment because they have been deprived of the exquisite pleasure of witnessing prolonged torture and violence.\n\nWhy should we ban violent sports if people enjoy them so much? You may well ask. The answer is simple: they are uncivilized. For centuries man has been trying to improve himself spiritually and emotionally \u2013 admittedly with little success. But at least we no longer tolerate the sight madmen cooped up in cages, or public floggings of any of the countless other barbaric practices which were common in the past. Prisons are no longer the grim forbidding places they used to be. Social welfare systems are in operation in many parts of the world. Big efforts are being made to distribute wealth fairly. These changes have come about not because human beings have suddenly and unaccountably improved, but because positive steps were taken to change the law.

They were there all the time: early morning, noon, and evening. There were little old ladies in gray sweats, young couples in Adidas shoes, middle-aged men with red faces. \"Come on!\" My friend Alex encouraged me to join him as he jogged by my house every evening. \"You'll feel great.\"\u00a0\n\n Well, I had nothing against feeling great and if Alex could jog every day, anyone could. So I took up jogging\u00a0seriously and gave it a good two months of my life, and not a day more. Based on my experience, jogging is\u00a0the most overvalued form of exercise around, and judging from the number of the people who left our\u00a0neighborhood jogging army. I'm not alone in my opinion.\u00a0\n\n First of all, jogging is very hard on the body. Your legs and feet have a real pounding (\u8ffd\u51fb) ruining down a road for two or three miles. I developed foot, leg, and back problems. Then I read about a nationally famous jogger\u00a0who died of a heart attack while jogging, and I had something else to worry about. Jogging doesn't kill hundreds of people, but if you have any physical weaknesses, jogging will surely bring\u00a0them\u00a0out, as they did with me.\u00a0\n\n Secondly, I got no enjoyment out of jogging. Putting one foot in front of the other for forty-five minutes\u00a0 isn't my idea of fun. Jogging is also a lonely pastime. Some joggers say, \"I love being out there with just my\u00a0thoughts\" Well, my thoughts began to bore me, and most of them were on how much my legs hurt.\u00a0\n\n And how could I enjoy something that brought me pain? And that wasn't just the first week: it was\u00a0practically every day for two months. I never got past the pain level, and pain isn't fun. What a cruel way to do it! So many other exercises, including walking, lead to almost the same results painlessly, so why jog?\n\nI don't jog any more, and I don't think I ever will. I'm walking two miles three times a week at a fast pace,\u00a0and that feels good. I bicycle to work when the weather is good. I'm getting exercise, and I'm enjoying it at the same time.

Whether it could or not, some people are worrying about the possibility that phones, power lines and Wi-Fi could be responsible for a range of illnesses, from rashes to brain tumors. \n\nSome say there is evidence to support the growing anxieties. David Carpenter, a professor of environmental health sciences at the university at Albany, in New York, thinks there's a greater than 95 percent chance that power lines can cause childhood leukemia(\u767d\u8840\u75c5). Also there's a greater than 90 percent chance that cell phones can cause brain tumors. \u201cIt's apparent now that there's a real risk, \u201d said Carpenter. \n\nBut others believe these concerns are unjustified. Dr Martha Linet, the head of radiation epidemiology(\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66) at the US National Cancer Institute, has looked at the same research as Carpenter but has reached a different conclusion. \u201cI don't support warning labels for cell phones, \u201d said Linet. \u201cWe don't have the evidence that there's much danger. \u201d\n\nStudies so far suggest a weak connection between EMFs(\u7535\u78c1\u573a) and illness\u2014 so weak that it might not exist at all. A multinational investigation of cell phones and brain cancer, in 13 countries outside the US, has been underway for several years.

As a teenager, Clinton played saxophone in a band. Townshend, who has the more severe hearing loss, was a guitarist for a band called the Who. He is one of the first rock musicians to call the public's attention to the problem of hearing loss from exposure to loud music.\n\nTemporary\uff08\u6682\u65f6\uff09 hearing loss can happen after only 15 minutes of listening to loud music. One early warning sign is when your ears begin to feel warm while you listen to music at a rock concert or through headphones. One later is that an unusual sound or a ringing is sometimes produced in your head after the concert.\n\n\"What happens is that the hair cells in the inner ear are damaged, but they're not dead,\" says physician and ear specialist Dr. Sam Levine. According to Dr. Levine, if you avoid further exposure to loud noise, it's possible to \n\n the cells\uff08\u7ec6\u80de\uff09 somewhat. However, he adds, \"Eventually, over a long period of time, hair cells are permanently damaged.\" And this is no small problem.\n\n What sound level is dangerous? According to Dr. Levine, regular exposure to noise above 85 decibels (\u5206\u8d1d) is considered dangerous. The chart below offers a comparison of decibel levels to certain sounds. Here's another measurement you can use. If you're at a rock concert and the music is so loud that you have to shout to make yourself heard, you' re at risk for hearing loss. That's when wearing protective devices such as earplugs becomes critical.\n\nThe facts are pretty frightening. But are rock bands turning down the volume.'? Most aren't. \"Rock music is supposed to be loud,\" says drummer Andrew Sather.\"I wouldn't have it any other way. And neither would the real fans of rock. \"\n\nContinued exposure to loud music and the failure to wear earplugs can lead to deafness, according to Dr. Levine. He states, \"There's no cure for hearing loss. Your ears are trying to tell you something. That ringing is the scream of your hair cells dying.

Man in white coat, athlete with electrodes attached and so on. And it's not a hard sell because drinking feels right - you're hot and sweating so surely replacing that fluid must be beneficial.\n\nWell earlier this year sports scientists in Australia did an extraordinary experiment that had never been done before.This group wanted to find out what happened to performance after \n\n So they took a group of cyclists and exercised them until they lost 3% of their total body weight in sweat.\n\nThen their performance was assessed after rehydration with either 1) nothing, 2) enough water to bring them back to 2% dehydration or 3) after full rehydration.\n\nSo far nothing unusual, but the difference between this and almost every other study that's ever been done on hydration was that the cyclists were blind to how much water they got. The fluid was given intravenously without them knowing the volume.\n\nThis is vital because we all, and especially athletes, have such an intimate(\u5bc6\u5207\u7684)psychological relationship with water consumption.\n\nRemarkably, there was no performance difference between those that were fully rehydrated and those that got nothing. This study was part of a growing movement to \"drink to thirst\" which hopes to persuade athletes not to over hydrate with the potentially fatal consequence of diluting your sodium level, causing hyponatraemia.\n\nPerhaps the result shouldn't be so surprising. Humans evolved doing intense exercise in extreme heat and dryness. We are able to tolerate losses in water relatively well whereas even slight over hydration can be far more dangerous.

They were taught methods meant to improve their memory, thinking and ability to perform everyday tasks.\n\nMore than 2,800 volunteered for the study called ACTIVE - short for Advanced (Cognitive) Training for Independent and Vital Elderly. Most studied when they were more than 70 years old. \n\nThe volunteers took one of several short training classes meant to help them keep their mental abilities. One class trained participants in skills including how to remember word lists. Another group trained in reasoning. A third group received help with speed-of-processing - speed of receiving and understanding information. A fourth group - the control group did not get any training.\n\nEarlier results had established that the training helped the participants for up to five years. Now, lead study writer George Rebok says, the research showed most of the training remained effective a full ten years later.\n\nProfessor Rebok and his team found that the people trained in reasoning and speed-of-processing did better on tests than the control group.\n\n\"We are wondering whether those effects which endured over time would still be there ten years following the training, and in fact, that's exactly what we found.\"\n\nThe effect on memory, however, seemed not to last as long. Still, the old people in any of the three classes generally reported less difficulty in performing daily activities than the control group. The total training time for the older people was between 10 and 15 hours. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Which statement is true according to the text\uff1f\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What can be inferred from the passage\uff1f\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What's the main idea of the fourth paragragh?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is the best title of the passage\uff1f\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u5065\u5eb7\u73af\u4fdd\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/9xzeg303450083.html"},

Yet most people who eat fast food know it's bad for them. So why do they keep eating it?\n\nThe answer is simple: the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long-term implications for most people. However, once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you, you may just want to stop eating fast food after all.\n\n1. Fast food makes you fat.\n\nA 15-year study of over 3,000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance. In others words, fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes. You probably know this already. But here's something you may not know.\n\n2. Fast food is addictive.\n\nThe more you eat fast food, the more you crave it. One study found that fast food is \u201ca potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations.\u201d If you eat fast food once a week or more, you may be addicted to it.\n\n3. Fast food is affecting your kids.\n\nAccording to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they've seen. Fast food marketers know this, and design ads accordingly. Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non-nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity.\n\n4. Fast food \u201cburgers\u201d don't have much burger in them.\n\nOne study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2.1 to 14.8 percent. So what makes up the rest of it, you ask? Chemical fillers and preservatives, mostly. That's why we see read horror stories about burgers that don't go bad.\n\n5. Even \u201chealthy\u201d fast food isn't that healthy.\n\nFast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options. The problem is, their definition of \u201chealthy\u201d is quite lax. One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King, the Garden Fresh Salad Chicken Caesar with TENDERGRILL Chicken and dressing, still has almost 500 calories and 28 grams of fat, and nearly a day's worth of sodium.\n\n6. Fast food is inhumane to animals.\n\nOkay, this one may not be a reason why fast is killing you, but it's still a compelling reason to stop eating fast food. 9 billion animals were slaughtered in the US alone in 2012 and much of that meat is for your fast food burgers and chicken sandwiches. Large factory farms resemble more of a \u201cbusiness\u201d than a \u201cfarm.\u201d Animals suffer in crowded spaces where they rarely have access to the outdoors or sunlight. They are pumped full of antibiotics to combat disease, which runs rampant in these conditions. Livestock is one of the biggest sources of pollution and environmental negligence, according to the UN.\n\n7. Fast food sodas are loaded with sugar.\n\nHigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is the cheap sweetener most fast food restaurants use in their sodas, desserts, and many other products. Princeton University researchers linked HFCS consumption to obesity in an animal study. Rats given HFCS gained more weight and body fat than those given table sugar.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:How many factors are mentioned which can account for the reason why fast food is slowly killing you?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:According to the text, we know that\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What is the purpose of the passage?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u5065\u5eb7\u73af\u4fdd\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/mjmag303450289.html"},

There have been few studies of overweight and cognitive functioning, possibly because it is generally believed that it is not a primary risk cause for poor cognitive performance. Losing weight, therefore, may help improve these mental functions, according to a new research led by John Gunstad, assistant professor of psychology at Kent State University.\n\nGrowing evidence suggests that being fat is linked to cognitive deficits (\u7f3a\u9677). So Gunstad and his team guessed that losing weight might improve mental function. For their study, they measured memory and attention in a group of 150 overweight participants, some of whom had some kind of operation for weight loss and some did not. All of the volunteers completed mental skills tests to assess their abilities of memory and attention at the beginning of the study, and again 12 weeks later. To begin with, about 24% of the patients showed damaged learning and 23% showed signs of poor memory when tested. At the end of the study, those who had lost weight after operation improved their scores into the average or above average range for cognitive functions. Scores for the volunteers who didn't lose weight dropped even further.\n\nThe study helped Gunstad to find out whether losing weight had any effect on mental function. Now that he's seen the positive effect that weight loss can have on memory and attention, he says he will next study those who choose to lose weight by the traditional way\u2014eating healthier and getting more active. He expects that losing weight in this way will have a similarly positive effect on the brain. \u201cIf we can improve the condition with operations, then we can probably produce the same change with behavioral weight loss as well,\u201d he says.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:There is less research on overweight and cognitive functions because researchers \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The result of Gunstad's study shows that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What is Gunstad planning to prove next in his research?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following is the best title for th e text?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u5065\u5eb7\u73af\u4fdd\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/teqzg303451991.html"},

First, most people recognize jumping rope as an excellent form of cardiovascular(\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u7684)exercise, but they also believe that it is simply too difficult. In other words, they don't think they'll be able to continue jumping for the near 20 minutes in order to achieve a beneficial physical effect. Second, many regard it as somewhat boring and overly repetitive(\u91cd\u590d\u4e4f\u5473\u7684)\u2014not as something fun or enjoyable. \n\nInstead of doing the usual two-foot bounce(\u8df3)over and over again, players good at rope-jumping often change their pattern every 10 or 20 jumps: a single bounce, a double-bounce, a skip, a knee-up, side swings, as well as a variety of other easy-to-learn free-style rope-jumping. \n\nNowadays researchers are discovering that jumping rope also prepares the brain for learning.

We do not know how and why it began because we do not know the complete history of the island. But we can certainly imagine the reasons for the beginning of the whistle language. There are many deep valleys on the island. A person on one side of valley cannot easily shout to a person on the other side. But he can whistle and be heard from four miles away, and the record is seven miles. The people who live on the island usually have good teeth, and this helps them to whistle well. They must also have good ears so that they can hear other whistlers. \n\nWe can understand why the whistle language continues. It is very useful on the island, and quite easy to learn. When somebody is hurt or ill, the whistle language takes the place of the telephone. If the sick person is a long way from the town, boys and men pass the news from one to another. A boy guarding cattle on a hillside whistles to a man fishing from his boat. The last one is able to describe the trouble fully and exactly to the doctor in town. People help each other in the same way when a car breaks or a cow is lost. \n\nThe whistle language is hundreds of years old, and probably it will continue to live for hundreds of years more.

The booklet says, \"You worry about me, but why not about yourself?\" Each adult looks around for the child as their faces are filled with confusion and discomfort.\n\nThe video shows that a few of the smokers quickly threw away their cigarettes or put their cigarettes away, showing that this experiment was affective at that moment.\n\nThe most influential element in the ad isn't the use of children or the responses from the smoking adults.

Prenatal care(\u4ea7\u524d\u62a4\u7406) and the time between birth and the age of 3 are critical periods for determining future cognitive ability and height. \n\n\"Prenatal care and prenatal nutrition are just incredibly important, even more so than we already knew,\" Case said in an interview. \n\nSince the study's data only included populations in the United Kingdom and the United States, the findings could not be applied to other regions, Case said. \n\nAnd how tall are the researchers? \n\nThey are both about 5 feet 8 inches tall, well above the average height of 5 feet 4 inches for American women. \n\n51.

In the same way, many societies use dances in religious ceremonies\u00a0\u00a0 47\u00a0\u00a0 to tell about important events.\n\n Music and dance are passed from one\u00a0\u00a0 48\u00a0 to another and thus become a permanent part of the society and\u00a0\u00a0 49\u00a0\u00a0 culture. Of course, as cultures come\u00a0\u00a0 50\u00a0\u00a0 contact with each other, the music and dance of one society may be accepted by other societies, or the different styles may be combined to\u00a0\u00a0 51\u00a0\u00a0 a new kind of music or dance. Some Latin American music, for example, has taken\u00a0\u00a0 52\u00a0\u00a0 from Indian cultures and mixed them with those from European and African cultures.\u00a0\u00a0 53\u00a0 , popular music from England and the US can be heard in countries\u00a0\u00a0 54\u00a0\u00a0 the world, \u00a0\u00a055\u00a0\u00a0 it has had an influence on musical tastes, especially among young people.\n\n36.

If you go to the seaside in Britain, you may see some small hills of sand, but nothing very impressive. Of course, Africa is home to many beautiful \u201csandscapes\u201d, but I was in China, so I went to Dunhuang.\n\n I had spent my first day looking at the beautiful Mogao caves. Now I wanted to experience something very different.\n\n I have been walking in Asia, Europe and America, but nothing prepared me for walking over hills of sand. Whenever I took a step up a hill, my feet would sink into the sand and move backwards. Sometimes it seemed as if I were moving in the wrong direction.\n\n I wanted to see the sunset so I had to climb to the top of the highest sand dune. The sun was beating down upon my back as I walked slowly over the sand. Some plants had managed to survive in the dry ground but not many.\n\n As I climbed higher, the hills of sand became steeper and my feet started to slip further backwards. I ended up with my hands and knees, crawling (\u722c\u884c)upwards through the top. I just let go if I would fall the way down. But I refused to give up: inch by inch, I made my way to the top of the sand dune.\n\n When I got there I was amazed by what I saw. The sand formed a very sharp point, just like a knife-edge. One side of the dune was bathed in sunshine, the other covered by shade. As I looked into the distance, the same pattern was repeated on all of the hilltops, and the difference between dark and light was beautiful.\n\n As the sun began to sink, the shadows grew longer and the light became warm and orange. The wind had come to life and sand was blown against my legs as I walked along the dunes. Soon it was getting dark and I could only just make out the line of footprints that marked my journey to the top of the hill. I slowly made my way down to the bottom, my path lit by the dying sun.\n\n65 The author probably went to climb the sand dunes \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ after he arrived at Dunhuang.\n\n A. on the afternoon of the first day \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0B. on the afternoon of the second day \n\n C. on the evening of the second day\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0D. on the evening of the first day \n\n66.

Wherever you look, there are people, people, people. The trains which leave or arrive every few minutes are packed. The streets are so crowded; there is hardly room to move on the pavements. It takes ages for a bus to get to you because the traffic on the roads has almost come to a standstill. Even when a bus does at last arrive, it's so full, and it can't take any more passengers. The smallest unexpected event can bring about conditions of complete chaos. The strange thing is not that people stand these conditions, but that they actually choose them in preference to anything else. \n\nLarge modern cites are too big to control. People living there are forced by their environment to take a wholly unnatural way of life. They lost touch with the land and rhythm of nature. It is possible to live in such an air-conditioned existence in a large city that you can hardly tell the season. A few flowers in a public park may remind you that it is spring or summer. All the simple, good things of life like sunshine and fresh air are hard to find. Even the distinction between days and nights is lost. \n\nThe funny thing about it all is that you pay dearly to live in a city. The demand for accommodation is so great that it is often impossible for ordinary people to buy a house of their own. The cost of living is also very high. Just about everything you buy is likely to be more expensive than it would be in the country. Besides, the crime rate in most cities is very high.

Do you like to post photos of yourself in restaurants to show others what an exciting life you have? Or do you like to write about how happily in love you are? Or perhaps you are of the subtle type who constantly complain about jobs but really just want to impress others with your important position.\n\nAccording to the results of a series of experiments conducted by Harvard University neuroscientists(\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6), the reward areas of our brain\u2014\u2014the same areas that respond to \u201cprimary rewards\u201d such as food \u2014\u2014are activated when we talk about ourselves. We devote between 30 to 40 percent of our conversation time to doing just that. Unfortunately, Bernstein says, some people can't tell the difference between sharing positive information that others might actually want to know and direct bragging. She suggests that bragging involves comparison, whether stated or implied. \n\n\u201cWe are expected to be perfect all the time. The result is that more and more people are carefully managing their online images\u201d. says Elizabeth Bernstein, a columnist with the Wall Street Journal. \n\nBut the issue is not limited to the Internet. In a fiercely competitive job market we must sell ourselves on multiple platforms and show that we are better than others. In fact, we have become so accustomed to bragging that we don't even realize we are doing it, says Bernstein. This is harmful to our relationships and puts people off.\n\nBernstein talked to some experts who said that people brag for all sorts of reasons: to appear worthy of attention; to prove to ourselves we are doing fine and that people who said we would fail are wrong; or simply because we're excited when good things happen to us.\n\n\u201cFeel sorry for them, because they're doing this unconscious, destructive thing that won't help them in the long run\uff0c\u201d said Professor Simian Valier, a research psychologist at Washington University. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The underlined word \u201csubtle\u201d in Para.2 is closest in meaning to \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d\uff0e\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which of the following is one of the features of braggarts?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What can we infer from the passage?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u4eba\u751f\u611f\u609f\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g3/201408/3odpg303452406.html"},

Now I can dimly remember the brightness of sunshine and what color red is. It would be wonderful to see again, but a calamity(\u5927\u707e\u96be) can do strange things to people. It occurred to me the other day that I might not have come to love life as I do if I hadn't been blind. I believe in life now. I am not so sure that I would have believed in it so deeply, otherwise. I don't mean that I would prefer to go without my eyes. I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate the more what I had left.\n\nLife, I believe, asks a continuous series of adjustments to reality. In spite of the fact the adjustment is never easy, I had my parents and teachers to help. The hardest lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself. If I hadn't been able to do that, I would have collapsed and become a chair rocker on the front porch for the rest of my life. When I say belief in myself I am not talking about simply the kind of self confidence that helps me down an unfamiliar staircase alone. That is part of it. But I mean something bigger than that: an assurance that I am, despite imperfections, a real, positive person; that there is a special place where I can make myself fit.\n\nIt took me years to discover and strengthen this assurance. It had to start with the most elementary things. Once a man gave me an indoor baseball. I thought he was laughing at me and I was hurt. \u201cI can't use this.\u201d I said. \u201cTake it with you\uff0c\u201d he urged me, \u201cand roll it around.\u201d The words stuck in my head. \u201cRoll it around\uff01\u201d By rolling the ball I could hear where it went. This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible: playing baseball. \n\nAll my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them, one at a time. I had to learn my limitations. It was no good to try for something that I knew at the start was wildly out of reach because that only invited the bitterness of failure.

Humor has been evaluated by many great minds such as Thomas Hobbes, who, in \u201cOn Nature\u201d, disliked humor, \u201cLaughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden thought of feeling far better than others.\u201d He thought humor to be a negative quality of human narrow-mindedness. \n\nHowever, Mordechai Gordon, Ph. D of Education, insists, \u201cHumor allows us to view the world from an angle that is amusing rather than serious.\u201d I agree with Gordon. Learning to look at the world through humor is important. \n\nIn the United States, every four years an election occurs. Without humor as a way to express their feelings, how else would Americans keep from clawing their eyes out and going the way of lemming? Television shows like \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d have become important parts of American culture. They are mothering the masses by metaphorically(\u9690\u55bb\u5730) airplane-ing politics into our mouths. They make politics fun. \n\nOf course, politics is only one type of humor. Social humor helps people through the twists and turns of the human condition. American pop culture promotes an unhealthy self- image. On the topic of self-image, Hari Kondabolu stands out. He has a joke about the popular musical group \u201cThe Pussycat Dolls\u201d, describing their hit song \u201cDon't Cha\u201d as a negative representation of women. He points out an obvious offence in American culture. \n\nA study from Loyola University of Maryland has shown that humor is one determining factor for selecting a mating partner. Amongst other things, mates look for an outstanding funny bone in a potential partner. \n\nOf course, humor is not always used for good purposes. Humor can be linked to vulgarity (\u7c97\u4fd7)and racism, but, like everything else, it has potential to unite human beings by allowing us to laugh at ourselves, our failures and our connection with one another. \n\nThough 1ife may seem tough and depressing at times, all I have to do is look in the mirror at my increased wrinkles(\u76b1\u7eb9) to know that there is a comedy out there that even Chaplin wasn't aware of. \n\nWith that in mind, remember to laugh with humanity and sometimes at humanity. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Hobbes believes that humor\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The fourth paragraph is developed mainly\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What can we learn from the last two paragraphs?\n\n", "grade": "\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u4eba\u751f\u611f\u609f\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/g1/201408/lz2og103453341.html"},

The smaller dolphin, Grace, shows off a few of her tricks, turning around and waving hello to the crowd. The most amazing thing about her, however, is that she's even swimming at all. She doesn't have a tail.\n\nGrace lost her tail as a baby when she got caught up in a fish trap. When the dolphin arrived at the Ocean Park in December 2005, she was fighting for her life. \u201c Is she going to make it\uff1f\u201d Her trainer, Abbey Stone, feared the worst. Grace did make it\u2014but her tail didn't. She ended up losing her flukes and the lower part of her peduncle.\n\nOver the past six years, she has learned to swim without her tail. Dolphins swim by moving their flukes and peduncle up and down. Grace taught herself to move another way\u2014like a fish! She pushes herself forward through the water by moving her peduncle from side to side.\n\nThe movements put harmful pressure on Grace's backbone. So a company offered to create a man\u00admade tail for her. The tail had to be strong enough to stay on Grace as she swam but soft enough that it wouldn't hurt her.\n\nThe first time Grace wore the artificial tail, she soon shook it off and let it sink to the bottom of the pool. Now, she is still learning to use the tail. Some days she wears it for an hour at a time, others not at all. \u201cThe new tail isn't necessary for her to feel comfortable\uff0c\u201d says Stone, \u201cbut it helps to keep that range of motion (\u52a8\u4f5c) and build muscles (\u808c\u8089)\uff0e\u201d\n\nNow, the dolphin is about to get an even happier ending. This month, Grace will star in Dolphin Tale, a film that focuses on her rescue and recovery. Her progress has inspired more than just a new movie. Many people travel from near and far to meet her.

His name was Mr. Basille. He wore a white cap and drove a white truck. As a 5-year-old boy, I couldn't take my eyes off the coin changer (\u81ea\u52a8\u6362\u5e01\u5668) fixed to his belt. He noticed this one day during a delivery and gave me a coin out of his changer.\n\nOf course, he delivered more than milk. There was cheese and other milk products. If we needed to change our order, my mother would write on a note-\u201cPlease add a bottle of buttermilk next delivery\u201d-and put it in the box along with the empty bottles. And then, the buttermilk would magically appear.\n\nAll of this was about more than convenience(\u65b9\u4fbf). There was a close relationship between families and their milkmen. Mr. Basille even had a key to our house, for those times when it was so cold outside that we put the box indoors, so that the milk wouldn't freeze. And I remember Mr. Basille from time to time taking a break at our kitchen table, having a cup of tea and telling stories about his delivery.\n\nThere is sadly no home milk delivery today. Big companies allowed the production of cheaper milk, as a result, making it difficult for milkmen to compete. Besides, milk is for sale everywhere, and it may just not have been practical to have a delivery service.\n\nRecently, an old milk box in the countryside I saw brought back my childhood memories. I took it home and planted it on the back porch (\u95e8\u5eca).

Being positive doesn't mean ignoring (\u5ffd\u89c6) what is happening around us.

We cannot think positively when we have problems, unless we are trained to. No one can speak a foreign language before studying and practicing for some time. The same thing is true about being positive. However, saying that everything is going to be all right, smiling for no reason, or ignoring problems without trying to solve them, is not being positive. It is daydreaming.\n\nPositive people expect the best and believe that a bad situation will be improved, but they are also practical (\u660e\u667a\u7684) people. They look for opportunities and solutions instead of doing nothing. They can improve a bad situation with a positive attitude. They can not only keep thinking of the problem that they face, but they can also refuse to let the problem affect their mind too much.\n\nPositive thinking is being hopeful, and hope brings light and happiness into our life.

But there is one question that has millions of current answers. That question is \"What's your name?\" Everyone gives a different answer, but everyone is correct.\n\nHave you ever wondered about people's names? Where do they come from? What do they\n\nmean?\n\nPeople's first names, or given names, are chosen by their parents. Sometimes the name of a grandparent or other member of the family is used. Some parents choose the name of a well-known person. A boy could be named George Washington Smith; a girl could be named Helen Keller Jones.\n\nSome people give their children names that mean good things. Clara means \"bright\"; Beatrice means \"one who gives happiness\"; Donald means \"world ruler\"; Leonard means \"as brave as a lion\".\n\nThe earliest last names, or surnames, were taken from place names. A family with the name Brook or Brooks probably lived near brook (\u0421\u03ea); someone who was called Longstreet probably lived on a long, paved road. The Greenwood family lived in or near a leafy forest.\n\nOther early surnames came from people's occupations. The most common occupational name is Smith, which means a person who makes things with iron or other metals. In the past, smiths were very important workers in every town and village. Some other occupational names are: Carter - a person who owned or drove a cart\uff08\u624b\u63a8\u8f66\uff09\uff1b Potter -a person who made pots and pans.\n\nThe ancestors (\u7956\u5148) of the Baker family probably baked bread for their neighbors in their native village. The Carpenter's great-great-great-grandfather probably built houses and furniture.\n\nSometimes people were known for the color of their hair or skin, or their size, or their special abilities. When there were two men who were named John in the same village, the John with the gray hair probably became John Gray. Or the John was very tall could call himself John\n\nTallman. John Fish was probably an excellent swimmer and John Lightfoot was probably a fast\n\nrunner or a good dancer.\n\nSome family names were made by adding something to the father's name. English-speaking people added -s or -son. The Johnsons are\n\n of John; the Roberts family's ancestor was Robert. Irish and Scottish people added Mac or Mc or O. Perhaps all of the MacDonnells and the McDonnells and the O'Donnells are descendants of the same Donnell.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Which of the following aspects\uff08\u65b9\u9762\uff09do the surnames in the passage NOT cover?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: According to the passage, the ancestors of the Potter family most probably \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:If an English couple whose ancestors lived near a leafy forest wanted their new-born son to become a world leader, the baby might be named \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984: The underlined word \"descendants\" in the last paragraph means a person's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "grade": "\u521d\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u653f\u6cbb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/6el7c303318100.html"},

Now, teleshopping is starting in Europe. In a number of European countries, people can\n\nturn on their TVs and shop for clothes, jewelry, food, toys and many other thing. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Teleshopping is becoming popular in Sweden. For example, the biggest Swedish teleshopping \n\ncompany sells different kinds of things on TV in 15 European countries, and in one year it made \\$ \n\n100 million. In France, there are two teleshopping channels (\u9891\u9053), and the French spend \\$ 20 \n\nmillion a year buying things through those channels. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Germany, until last year, teleshopping was on one channel for one hour every day. Then \n\nthe government allowed more teleshopping.\u00a0 Other channels can now open for telebusiness, \n\nincluding teleshoping, because it allows people to do their shopping without leaving their homes. \n\nWith all the problems of traffic in the cities, this is an important reason to allow more teleshopping.\n\nBut at the same time, other Europeans do not like this new way of shopping. They call teleshopping \n\n\" junk on the air\". Many Europeans worry about the quality of the things for sale on TV. Good quality\n\nis important to them, and they believe they can't be sure about the quality of the things they see on TV. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The need for high quality means that European teleshopping companies will have to be different\n\nfrom American companies. They will have to be more careful about the quality of the things they sell.\n\nThey will also have to work harder to sell things that the buyers can't touch or see in person. \n\n1.

But recent findings offer good news for older people and for people worried about getting older. Researchers found that people become happier and experience less worry after they reach the age of 50. In fact, they say by the age of 85, people are happier with their life than they were when they were 18 years old.\n\nThe findings came from a survey of more than 340,000 adults in the United States. The Gallup Organization questioned them by telephone in 2008. At that time, the people were between the ages of 18 and 85. The researchers asked questions about emotions like happiness, sadness and worry. They also asked about mental or emotional stress.\n\nArthur Stone in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stony Brook University in New York led the study. His team found that levels of stress were highest among adults between the ages of 24 and 25. The findings showed that stress levels dropped sharply after people reached their fifties.\n\nThe study also showed that men and women have similar feeling patterns as they grow older. However, women at all ages reported more sadness, stress and worry than men.\n\nResearchers say they do not know why happiness increases as people get older. One theory is that, as people grow older, they grow more thankful for what they have and have better control of their feelings. They so spend less time thinking about bad experiences.\n\nProfessor Stone says the emotional patterns could be linked to changes in how people see the world, or maybe even changes in brain chemistry.\n\nThe researchers also considered possible influences like having young children, being unemployed or being single.

This report will examine this problem and provide some possible ways to solve it.\n\nWe live in a society that is producing and using electronics(\u7535\u5b50\u4ea7\u54c1) all the time. It is often cheaper to buy new products than to repair old ones. Also, through clever advertising, companies always encourage people to change their old TVs, mobile phones and computers for the latest models. E-waste is created when we throw away old ones. In the EU alone, about 8,700,000 tons of e-waste is produced each year. Sadly, just over 1,000,000 tons is recycled.\n\nBurying(\u586b\u57cb) e-waste or burning it cause serious problems for the environment. Electronics have dangerous things in them. These things can then get into the ground or pollute the air when they are burnt.\n\nIn recent years, \\_\\_\\_\\_. However, their plans are not always managed properly. Sometimes electronics are just sent to poor countries such as Ghana. Here they are often burnt in public areas, which is very bad for people's health. Setting up recycling centers is a good way to solve this problem. E-cycling centers could recycle the parts that can be reused and deal with the rest properly.\n\nAnother way is to make producers responsible(\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb) for their used products. This means that producers must take back old products which are no longer wanted. They should then make sure \n\n are properly recycled or reused.\n\nAs for us, we should try to cut down on e-waste.

A good gardener will cut away the overgrown and unwanted branches(\u6811\u679d). They can make the trees more beautiful and healthier. But sometimes we'd better leave the trees to grow in their own way. Because the inexperienced gardeners will damage(\u6bc1\u574f) the trees.\n\n First, pruning may be done to make sure that trees in good shape or size. Maybe people want to get a tree of the right height and at the same time to help the growth of small side branches. Then people can make the tree's appearance thick or give it a special shape.\n\nSecondly, pruning may be done to make the tree healthier. You may cut out diseased or dead branches. The health of a tree may be encouraged by removing branches that are blocking up (\u5c01\u95ed)the center and so stopping the free movement of air.\n\n One result of pruning is that an open wound is left on the tree and this provides an easy chance for disease, but the wound will heal(\u6108\u5408). Often there is a race between the healing and the disease as to whether the tree will live or die, so that there is a period when the tree is in danger. Every gardener should try to reduce that danger of death as soon as possible. It is important to make the area, which has been pruned, smooth and clean, because healing will be slowed down by roughness(\u7c97\u7cd9). You should allow the cut surface to dry for a few hours and then pain it with one of the special materials. Pruning is usually done in winter, because you can see the shape of the tree clearly and also it is very unlikely(\u672a\u5fc5\u7684) that the cuts you make will bleed. If this happens, it is impossible to paint them properly(\u5408\u9002\u5730).\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "grade": "\u521d\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u79d1\u6559\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/vl6cc303292444.html"},

Hockey Canada has followed the lead of USA Hockey in preventing bodychecking (\u8eab\u4f53\u62e6\u622a) below age 13. A bad head injury of Sidney Crosby, the hockey's greatest star, opened the eyes of hockey people everywhere. This country's children have been facing similar danger at early ages, and Hockey Canada had to deal with a deep worry in the minds of Canadians to make the rule change. The liking for bodychecking from an early age is part of what makes Canadian hockey what it is.\n\n The change in rules should be taken as a chance to draw special attention to skill development in an environment free of danger.\u00a0 It may also control the loss of thousands of young players who don't enjoy that environment.\n\n For years, many Canadian hockey parents and coaches have insisted that bodychecking at early ages is necessary to ensure that players can do it safely at older ages. True or not, there may be a safer way to teach hitting than to make younger players pay a price for it in head injuries. When USA Hockey changed its rules for the 2011-2012 season, it also created bodychecking-education programs that will be mandatory(\u5f3a\u5236\u7684) for all coaches,\u00a0 including those teaching players in\u00a0 the pre-checking ages. And it began to encourage more \"touch\" - without real bodychecking - from 9 t0 12. It also made the rules for 13 and up stricter. The USA is trying to show that it's possible to teach hockey protective skills without putting11 and 12-year-olds in greater danger. It's worth the try.\n\n Hockey Canada has taken serious steps to do away with hits on the head. However, it's hard to change a sports culture so connected with who we are as a country. Too often, bodychecking has been used to try to separate a player from his head rather than from the ball. Children were paying a price for this country's love of the game.\n\n There are always changes in Canada's game, and the change in the bodychecking age sends the clearest message yet to coaches and parents that player safety is paramount(\u81f3\u4e0a\u7684) in the game.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:We can tell that the problem of bodychecking in Canada\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does the writer want to tell us in Paragraph 2?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What can we learn from the passage?\n\nA.

They can understand why an\n\nelephant or a tiger is important because they are big, beautiful animals. It is much harder for\n\nthem to understand how important the animals in the wetlands are. These small animals,\n\nsuch as frogs and snails, play a very important part in keeping the balance of nature.\n\n All plants and animals are part of the food chain(\u94fe).If the small wetlands animals\n\ndie, some animals in the food chain will have nothing to eat.

At that time, they decided to stop speaking Spanish at home and only communicate in English. This was because they were now living in an English-speaking country.\n\n Now the Vieira children are adults, and they sometimes travel to Spain to visit their family and friends. But they cannot communicate with them. Unfortunately this is common. When people move to new countries, they often leave their own customs and mother language behind. This is a mistake because there are many benefits to knowing more than one language.\n\n One advantage of speaking more than one language is that you can communicate directly with more people around the world. You do not have to depend on others to talk for you, so you're more independent. People who know only one language must use others to help them communicate.\n\n Furthermore, speaking a second language also allows people to experience other cultures and customs more effectively. Local expressions, vocabulary, and even jokes can have a powerful effect on a person's understanding of another culture. So, knowing more than one language increases your knowledge of other cultures.\n\n Finally, having more \n\n improves relationships between countries. If people from different countries can communicate well, the world can become closer. Countries will then have more respect for each other and better understand each other's problems.\n\n The benefits of knowing more than one language are clear. In fact, there are no disadvantages.

Iceland is a country, one-tenth of which is covered with ice. However, it is said that Iceland is the land of heat.

When hiking through one of Iceland's many ancient lava fields, you may notice something strange. White steam is rising from each \n\n in front of you. Iceland is covered with vents which steam can pass out of. The steam comes from naturally heated rocks and hot water below the Earth's surface (\u8868\u9762).\n\n Like steam vents, hot springs can be seen here and there in the ancient lava fields. Blue Lake is the most famous hot spring in Iceland. It isn't far from the capital city of the country. The water and white earth in it can make your skin as soft as a newborn baby's skin. Enjoy that water, because it has traveled a long way. It starts nearly two kilometers under Blue Lake. There, water from the ocean continues moving up slowly into the spaces between hot rocks below the surface. And then the water is heated by hot rocks. Powerful machines and long pipes (\u6c34\u7ba1) help bring the heated water to the surface. People in Iceland use natural hot water for hot springs. Besides, they use it to create electricity that can be used to heat homes and even greenhouses.\n\n Iceland is one of the few places on the Earth where active volcanoes lie below ice.

And now! you can google it and find the answer immediately!\n\nGoogle is the most popular Internet search engine in the world. It was invented by two students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They met in 1993, when they were studying computer science at Stanford University, USA. They dreamed of producing something that could also answer any question in seconds.\n\nInternet search engines at that time were slow and gave many websites that weren't useful. In January 1996, Page and Brin decided to make a better and faster search engine. They thought the results should be based on the most popular websites.\n\nNobody would give them money for their project, so they used their own money. They also borrowed money from family and friends. Then, in 1998, they were given a \n\n for \\$100,000, and they started their own company. Their first office was in a friend's garage. The company's name is Google, a word which comes from mathematics. A \u201cgoogle\u201d is a very high number---- 1 followed by a hundred zeros.\n\nThe google search engine was soon used by thousands of people worldwide because it was fast, easy and correct. By 2002 it was the biggest search engine on the Internet. Now, more questions have been answered by Google than any other Internet service, from sport to science, and from music to medicine.

She cuts paper images of people and puts them on walls or sets them up on sidewalks. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art, but as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums and galleries. People in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and imaginative style. Some museums have already bought some of her works.\n\nAdvertising companies also use street art in their ads because it gives people the feelings of youth and energy.\n\nIn Today's world the Internet has a big influence on street art. Artists can show their pictures to the audience all over the world. Many city residents, however, say that seeing a picture on the Internet is never as good as seeing it live.\n\nThe street art movement lives with the energy and life of a big city.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What can we learn from Paragraph1?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why do street artists usually get into trouble?\u00a0 Because \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Swoon becomes famous mainly because\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Street artists can show their pictures to the whole world\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Which of the following is NOT the reason young artists choose street art?\n\n", "grade": "\u521d\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u793e\u4f1a\u73b0\u8c61\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/dmm8c303314851.html"},

But those who make pirated goods are becoming rich without doing any hard work.\n\n The authors should ask for a fair price for their work. Earlier this year there was much talk about how much KTV clubs should pay the music companies for using their songs.\n\n The copyright fee (\u7248\u6743\u8d39) also should be fair to the users.

The latest\u00a0craze is sometimes a style of clothes or a hairstyle. Sometimes it is a game or a TV programme.\n\nIn the 20\n\n century a lot of crazes started in the USA and then became popular in the USA andthen became popular in other parts of the world. American youth culture has spread through tourism , TV , films, magazines and music videos.\n\nOne of the biggest crazes was the hula hoop\uff08\u547c\u5566\u5708\uff09.

Some people say that the idea\n\nstarted in the factory of the Frisbee Baking Company in Connecticut. Workers there threw metal\u00a0pans to each other during their breaks. Two businessmen made a plastic type of the flying pans,\u00a0\u00a0and sold their products to Wham-O. They became a big business.\n\nSo businesses usually help to produce a craze. Yoyos were another example. In the Philippines,\u00a0 where its name means \u201ccomeback\u201d, the yoyo was a popular toy in the 1920s. But\u00a0it didn't become a global (\u4e16\u754c\u6027\u7684) craze until an American called Donald Duncan bought the\u00a0idea and sold it to the world. Around 100 million people bought yoyos in 1962 and 1963.\n\nMost crazes come and go, but sometimes they survive. When the big skateboard started in California in 1965, many parents and governments said that the boards were dangerous, and they\u00a0were not allowed in some areas.

For the pedestrians (\u884c\u4eba), it's very important to be careful when they are walking on the road. Therefore, when we walk across the road, we must try to walk along the pavements(\u4eba\u884c\u9053). We must stop and look both ways before crossing the road.

People rap to express how they feel about their lives and problems.\n\nRapping in class.\n\nWould you like to rap in class? Well, actually hip pop music is played in more than 10,000 schools in the USA. Why? There is a new school program called \u201cFlocabulary\u201d in which teachers use texts and hip hop CDs to help teach different school subjects. The words of the songs are just what students are studying. This makes learning easy and fun. Students and teachers are excited about the good results it has had on exam marks. Mr. Lee, a teacher in a high school, said, \u201cI've used hip hop songs in class, and I have never seen my students so crazy about history! You can't imagine how well they remember what I teach!

The word \u201cFlocabulary\u201d comes from the word \u201cflow\u201d and \u201cvocabulary\u201d. \u201cFlow\u201d is a rap word for \u201cstyle\u201d, or the way a rapper says the words of a song. \u201cVocabulary\u201d means the words you have to learn in a language. How did he get the idea? Well, he realized he could remember the words of a hip hop song very easily. So, why not make lessons into songs?

In Europe for example, coffee shops are common places for people to meet friends and to talk while they drink coffee. On the other hand, places like this were not as common in North America in the past. Instead, people in North America liked to drink coffee in their homes with friends. The coffee culture in the USA changed when Starbucks coffee shops spread across the country.\n\nThe first Starbucks coffee shop opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle, Washington, in the USA. It was a small coffee shop that cooked its own coffee beans. The coffee shop's business did well, and by 1981 there were three Starbucks stores in Seattle.\n\nThings really began to change for the company in 1981.That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who\n\nStarbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, which caused his great interest. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did. In 1982, the original Starbucks owners hired Schultz as the company's head of marketing\uff08\u5e02\u573a\u8425\u9500\uff09.\n\nIn 1983, Schultz traveled to Italy. The special environment of the espresso (\u6d53\u5496\u5561) bars there caught his eyes. Back in the USA, Schultz created an environment for Starbucks coffee shops that was comfortable and casual, and customers everywhere seemed to like it. Starbucks began opening more stores across the USA. Then the company opened coffee shops in other countries as well. Today, there are more than 16,000 Starbucks coffee shops all over the world.\n\nHowever, that does not mean Starbucks has not had problems. In fact, many Starbucks stores have closed over the past few years. On the one hand, this is because there were too many coffee shops competing for business in one small area. On the other hand, stores in some countries closed because the coffee culture there did not match with the \u201cfeel the same everywhere\u201d environment offered by Starbucks.\n\n The underlined word \u201cran\u201d in Paragraph 3 probably means \u201c\n\n According to the passage, which is the right order for the following sentences?\n\na.

Here are several traditional Chinese foods:\n\nEggs hold a special meaning in many cultures, and China is no exception(\u4f8b\u5916). The Chinese believe eggs mean producing something new. After a baby is born, parents may hold a \"red egg and ginger party,\" where they pass out eggs to announce the birth. In some areas of China the number of eggs represents the sex of the child, for example, an even number(1,3,5,---) for a girl, and an odd number(2,4,6---) if a boy has been born.\n\nNoodles are a symbol of longlife in Chinese culture. They are as much a part of a Chinese birthday celebration as a birthday cake with lit candles is in many countries. Since noodles represent long life, it is considered very unlucky to cut it off.\n\nAlthough westerners sometimes may be very sorry to see fish lying on a plate, in China a whole fish is a symbol of richness. In fact, at a party it is traditional to serve the whole fish last, pointed toward the valued guest. Fish also has a special meaning because the Chinese word for fish, yu, sounds like the word for richness or plenty, and it is believed that eating fish will help your wishes come true in the year to come.\n\nA very popular dish during the Dragon Boat Festival is Zongzi. This tasty dish is made of rice dumplings with meat, peanut or other delicious food in bamboo leaves.

They live in eastern Ghana (\u52a0\u7eb3), where the sunshine hugs all the time. They are very friendly. Now let's have a look at how the Akuapem people receive a visitor.\n\nA visitor is often welcomed warmly in a family of Akuapem. After the visitor is welcomed into the house, he is offered a seat and water at the very beginning, for the host (\u4e3b\u4eba) thinks that the visitor must have come from a very long trip and is in need of water. Then the host family greet the visitor by saying \u201cAkwaaba.\u201d More interestingly, if there is a group of visitors, the host will greet the visitors from right to left. And the host shakes only with his right hand, because the left hand is regarded dirty according to the Akuapem people.\n\nNext, the visitor is asked how his trip was and why he has come. While the conversation is going on, the wife and children, especially girls, are cooking food for the visitor. The visitor can choose the food. After the visitor has finished eating, the host and the visitor continue their conversation. Usually this is a short one since the visitor is getting ready to say goodbye.\n\nWhen the visitor is leaving, he is often given some food to take along. He is also accompanied (\u966a\u4f34) by one of the children to the nearest station. The child who accompanies the visitor will not come back home until the visitor leaves safely.\n\nNo matter if he is a close friend or just a passer-by (\u8fc7\u8def\u4eba), this is always the way that the friendly Akuapem people receive a visitor.\n\nB\uff09\u9605\u8bfb\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u9605\u8bfb\u7b2cI\u5377\u7b2c\u4e09\u5927\u9898D\u7bc7\u77ed\u6587\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u77ed\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\u56de\u7b54\u4e0b\u5217\u95ee\u9898\u3002\uff08\u51715\u5c0f\u9898\uff0c\u8ba110\u5206\uff09\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the visitor offered at first by the family of Akuapem?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why does the host shake only with his right hand?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Who are cooking food while the host is chatting with the visitor?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:When will the child who accompanies the visitor to the station come back home?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:What does the article mainly talk about\uff1f\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n", "grade": "\u521d\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed", "comments": "\u96be\u5ea6:\u4e2d\u6863,\u6765\u6e90:\u4e0d\u8be6", "topic": "\u653f\u6cbb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/b6rtc303320164.html"},

When other rabbits see this tail moving up and down, they run too. They know that there is danger. The rabbit has told them something without making a sound. It has given them a signal.\n\nMany other animals use this kind of language. When a bee found some food, it goes back to his home. It cannot tell the other bees where the food is by speaking to them, but it does a little dance in the air. This tells the bees where the food is.\n\nSome animals say things by making sounds. A dog barks, for example, when a stranger\n\ncomes near. A cat purrs (\u53d1\u51fa\u547c\u565c\u547c\u565c\u7684\u58f0\u97f3)when pleased.

We are able to give each other information, to tell or inform other people what is in our mind or how we feel. By writing words down we can remind ourselves of the things what have happened, or send messages to people far away. No animals can do this. No animals has the wonderful power of language.\n\nNo one knows how man learned to make words. Somehow he learned to make them. As centuries went by, he made more and more new words. This is what we mean by language. \u00a0People living in different countries made different kinds of words. Today there are about fifteen hundred different languages in the world. A very large English dictionary, for example, \u00a0contains four or five hundred thousand words. But we do not know all these. The words we know are called vocabulary.
