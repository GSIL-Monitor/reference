Doctors find that these people have trouble in sleeping, But, most important, constant loud noise can cause a loss of hearing.\n\n Scientists use a unit of measure called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talking measures between 40 and 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels.

On a sunny day with a good breeze(\u5fae\u98ce), you'll see hundreds of colorful kites flying in the sky. They have all kinds of shapes like swallows and peaches. Some of the shapes have special meanings. For example, swallows mean good luck and peaches bring you a long life.\n\n The city of Weifang in Shandong is the home of the kite. The city holds an international kite festival in April every year. There are competitions for kite-flying skills and new styles of kites. The most famous is the competition for the \"Kite King \". Thousands of kite fans from more than 30 countries visit the city to take part in the competitions, or to just enjoy this colorful event(\u4e8b\u4ef6).\n\n The largest kite in the world is a big \"octopus (\u7ae0\u9c7c)\". It's about 1,100 square meters, twice as big as a basketball court. Li Jingyang, a kite fanin Jilin, spent eight months making it in 2008.\n\n The kite was invented by Chinese people over 2,000 years ago. According to historical (\u5386\u53f2\u7684) record, kites were first used by soldiers to send news to their friends. In the Tang Dynasty, flying kites became a popular game played by everyone.\n\n As it was introduced to the West in the ll00s, the kite brought a great influence(\u5f71\u54cd) on Western life.\n\n In 1782, the lightning rod (\u907f\u96f7\u9488) was invented with the help of a kite. Modern aircraft came from kites, too. At the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC, a board reads: \"The earliest man-made aircrafts were the kites and missiles (\u6295\u5c04\u6b66\u5668) of ancient China.\"\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What activity is very popular in spring?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What do people hope for when flying kites shaped like swallows?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Why do thousands of people visit the city of Weifang in April every year?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:When did Chinese people invent the kite?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Which of the following sentences is TRUE?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n\u5c0f\u98985:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/tvwsc203259902.html"},

Even a dog likes it!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, Tige, I won't say unkind words to you any more.\u201d Tige waved its tail happily.\n\nThe boy thought and thought.

When I traveled across to the other side of the island (\u5c9b\u5c7f), I could see the other islands, and I said to myself, \u201cPerhaps I can get there with a boat. Perhaps I can get back to England one day.\u201d \n\nSo I decided to make myself a boat. I cut down a big tree, and then began to make a long hole (\u6d1e) in it. It was hard work, but about six months later, I had a very fine canoe (\u72ec\u6728\u821f). Next, I had to get it down to the sea. How silly I was! Why didn't I think before I began work? Of course, the canoe was too heavy. I couldn't move it! I pulled and pushed and tried everything, but it didn't move. I was very unhappy for a long time after that.\n\nThat happened in my fourth year on the island. In my sixth year I did make myself a smaller canoe, but I did not try to escape in it. The boat was too small for a long journey, and I did not want to die at sea. The island was my home now, not my prison, and I was just happy to be alive.\u00a0 A year or two later, I made myself a second canoe on the other side of the island. I also built myself a second house there, and so I had two homes.\n\nMy life was still busy from morning to night. There were always things to do or to make. I learnt to make new clothes for myself from the skins of dead animals. They looked very strange, it is true, but they kept me dry in the rain.\n\nI kept food and tools (\u5de5\u5177) at both my houses, and also wild goats (\u5c71\u7f8a). There were many goats on the island, and I made fields with high fences to keep them in. They learnt to take food from me, and soon I had goats' milk to drink every day. I also worked hard in my corn (\u7389\u7c73) fields.

However, there is still some advice for you to follow.\n\n First, look at why you do it. In other words, what's the result of doing this thing? If your bad habit is shouting at people when you are unhappy or under pressure, what do you get from it? It may make you feel a little better for the moment. Or maybe you have a bad habit of leaving your homework undone. The result could be that you get more time to spend on the Internet!\n\n Next, take a look on the other hand. What are you losing because of your habit? Shouting at other people is a bad habit because it makes people around you feel bad and unhappy. Leaving your homework undone is a bad habit because you may be punished by your teacher. Having more Internet time means that you are losing the chance to learn the things that you need to learn. When you think that way, you'll find that it's not wise to keep your bad habit! Now it is time to make a decision. What will you choose?

He had an unusual voice and he wanted to work in Disney's cartoon(\u52a8\u753b\u7247) film for children. When Walt Disney heard Nash's voice, he said\u201dStop! That's our duck!\u201d\n\nThe duck was the now-famous Donald Duck, who first appeared in 1934 in the firm The Wise Little Hen. Donald lived in an old houseboat(\u6c34\u4e0a\u4f4f\u5bb6) and wore his sailor jacket and hat. Later that year he became a star after an eight \u2013 minute Mickey Mouse film. The cinema audience liked him because he was lazy and greedy(\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7684), and because he lost his temper (\u53d1\u813e\u6c14) very quickly. And they loved his voice when he became angry with Mickey's eight nephews(\u4f84\u5b50). Soon Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse himself, probably because he wasn't a goody-goody like Mickey.\n\nIn the 1930S, \u2018 40s and \u2018 50s Donald and his friends Mickey, Goofy and Pluto made hundreds of Disney cartoons. He also made educational films about the place of the USA in the world, and safety in the home. Then in 1966 Donald Duck and his voice disappeared \u2013 there were no more new cartoons.\n\nClarence Nash died in February, 1985.

In Febbruary, Nelson Mandela was set free after 27 years in prison. In October, East and West Germany became one country again. Then at the end of 1990, the World Wide Web was born. For this final event we have one man to thank, Tim Berners-Lee, the father of the Web.\n\nBerners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955 in London, England. His parents, both computer designers, encouraged him to think and work creativelhy as he grew up. He was an excellent student and naturally took an interest in computers and science.\n\nAfter graduating from Oxford University, Tim went to work at a science research centre in Sfwitzerland. There be developed some of the different systems that would later become the Web. The first was HTML, the computer language used to make web pages. The second was an address system that let\u00a0 computers anhywhere find each other and send and receive information. In 1990, while still at the science centre in Switzerland, he put them together to make the first Internet browser. It could run on any computer and allowed people to create\u00a0 share their information with the rest of the world.\n\nTim knew that the more people used the Web, the more useful it would be. He wasn't interested in money but knowledge, so he gave out his invention for free to anyone who was interested. Many were interested and the growth of the Internet began.\n\nToday Tim works as a professor at the MIT in America, researching new and interesting ways to use the Web. He has received many awards from governments and organizations for his efforts. He is still not very interested in money. That is why he is so admired by his students and workmates.

They are under pressure (\u538b\u529b) every day. They need a (1)\n\n from it. Parents should ask children to do something else. But not let them relax in front of the TV.\u00a0 A hobby is the perfect answer. \n\nThere are many different kinds of hobbies. Chess is a good example. It is a very enjoyable game and it also helps children develop their thinking skills.\n\nCollecting something is also a good hobby for children. A child can collect almost anything: \n\nkey rings, stamps, postcards, old coins, etc. Many of these collecting can be both interesting and fun. They teach children a lot and broaden (\u5f00\u9614)their knowledge. For example, gardening (\u56ed\u827a) is a useful hobby because it is a physical activity and it also teaches children about nature.\n\n (2) \n\n Children may become experts in something if they really love their hobbies. Children will also learn to become more organized and make places, for example in collecting something. Hobbies will also teach children a lot about responsibility(\u8d23\u4efb).\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\uff081\uff09\u5904\u5212\u7ebf\u7684\u8bcd\u3002\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:\u5728\u77ed\u6587\u4e2d\u627e\u51fa\u53ef\u4ee5\u66ff\u6362\u4e0b\u9762\u6240\u7ed9\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u4e00\u53e5\u8bdd\u3002\n\nIt is a good hobby for children to collect something.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:How many kinds of hobbies can you find in this passage? \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:\u5728\u4e0b\u9762\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u6a2a\u7ebf\u4e0a\u586b\u4e0a\u6070\u5f53\u7684\u8bcd\uff0c\u6539\u5199\u539f\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u3002\n\nGardening a useful hobby.

Like most skills, it improves with practice. If you want to meet people and make friends, you must be willing\uff08\u4e50\u610f\uff09 to take some action. You must first go where there are people. You won't make friends staying home alone.\n\nJoin a club or group, talking with those who like the same things you do is much easier. Or join someone in some activity. Many people are nervous when talking to new people. After all, meeting strangers means facing the unknown. And it's human nature to feel a bit uncomfortable about the unknown.\n\nMost of our fears about dealing with new people come from doubts about ourselves. We imagine other people are giving an opinion about us-finding us too tall or too short, too this or too that. But don't forget that they must be feeling the same away. Try to accept(\u63a5\u53d7)yourself as you are, and try to put the other person at ease(\u4e0d\u62d8\u675f). You'll both feel more comfortable.\n\nTry to keep self-confident(\u81ea\u4fe1)even when you don't feel that way when you enter a room full of strangers, such as a new classroom, walk tall(\u8dbe\u9ad8\u6c14\u626c)and straight, look directly at other people and smile. If you see someone you'd like to speak to, say something.

Polar bears are the largest of all the land predators. They can run across snow and swim in icy water for hours without rest. Their favorite food is seal. Not all big animals live on small animals. Hippos have heavy bodies and huge mouths. But they don't eat animals. They just eat grass.\n\n Some predators use speed to catch their prey. Cheetahs are the fastest animals on land. They can run up to 70km an hour. Other predators use their senses to find their food. Sharks can see, smell, hear, feel and taste. They can also sense electrical currents(\u7535\u6d41 )from other animals' bodies. Some fish try to hide themselves, but with this sixth sense, sharks can always find them. Sharks have smooth bodies. This helps them swim without using lots of energy. They need to save their energy because they never really sleep and never stop hunting. Flying is a useful skill for many predators in the sky. The butcher bird is the most interesting predator. It has a special way of eating its prey. First it kills its prey. Then it hangs it on a fence or in a tree, just like a butcher hangs meat in his shop. Finally, it eats its prey.\n\n Some people hunt and kill more animals than any other predator.

Stopping and getting off a bike is easier than stopping and getting out of your car. You can bike to work and benefit (\u53d7\u76ca) from the enjoyable exercise without polluting the environment. You don't even have to ride all the way.\n\nFolding (\u6298\u53e0) bikes work well for people who ride the train. Just fold the bike and take it with you. You can do the same on an airplane.

You don't have to go to a driving school --- a friend can teach you. The person with you isn't allowed to take money for the lesson unless he's got a teacher's license.\n\nBefore you're allowed to have a full license, you have to take a driving test. You can take a test in your own car, but it has to be fit for the road. In the test you have to drive round for about half an hour and then answer a few questions. If you don't pass the test, you're allowed to take it again a few weeks later if you want to. In 1970 a woman passed her fortieth test after 212 driving lessons! When you've passed your test, you don't have to take it again, and you're allowed to go on driving as long as you like. Britain's oldest driver was a man who drove in 1974 at the age of 100.\n\nBefore 1904 everyone was allowed to drive, even children. Then from 1904 car drivers had to have a license.

It can help you to develop a healthy attitude (\u6001\u5ea6). A study shows that the people who are more confident are much happier. They can have more chance to make themselves successful. Here are some suggestions about how to be more confident.\n\nSpeak loud\u00a0\u00a0 When you are not confident, you can't do well what you want to do. You speak in a voice so low that other people can hardly hear you. Try to speak \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_(1) enough so that people can hear you clearly. The high voice can \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_(1) you become more confident.\n\nPlay sports\u00a0\u00a0 Physical exercise makes you tired but completely relaxed. \n\nEncourage yourself\u00a0 Write down a list of things you did during the day to see how many things you have done well. Did you finish your homework? Did you tell a joke that made everybody laugh? Give yourself praise for the good things you've done.\n\nPick up a hobby\u00a0\u00a0 If you like singing, sing as much as you can. In some ways, a hobby can make you outstanding. And it will make you happy and confident.\n\nGet rid of (\u6d88\u9664) fear\u00a0 Fear comes along with failure (\u5931\u8d25). But it's easy to overcome (\u514b\u670d) if you know that failure is part of your life. Don't hide your head just because you said something stupid last time.

When groups of men and women watch a movie together, the men usually end up telling the women to shut up. Men can either talk or watch the screen---they can't do both---and they don't understand that women can. Besides(\u6b64\u5916), women think that the point of all getting together is to have a good time and develop relationships--not just to sit there like couch potatoes staring (\u76ef\u7740) at the screen.\n\nDuring the ad breaks, a man often asks a woman to explain the plot(\n\n) and tell him where the relationship between the characters is going. He is unable, unlike women, to read the small body language signals that show how the characters are feeling emotionally(\u60c5\u7eea\u4e0a). Since women originally spent their days with the other women and children in the group, they developed the ability to communicate successfully because they want to keep relationships. For a woman, speech continues to have such a clear purpose: to build relationships and make friends. For men, to talk is to connect to the facts.\n\nMen see the telephone as a communication tool for sending facts and information to other people, but a woman sees it as a way of keeping relationship. A woman can spend two weeks on vacation with her girlfriend and, when she returns home, telephone the same girlfriend and talk for another two hours.\n\nThere is no convincing(\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u7684)evidence that social conditioning, the fact that girls' mothers talked them more, is the reason why girls talk more than boys. Psychiatrist Dr. Michael Lewis, author of \n\n, conducted experiments that found mothers talked to and looked at baby girls more often than baby boys. Scientific evidence shows parents reply to the brain differences of their children. Since a girl's brain is better organized to send and receive speech, we talk to them more. As a result, mothers who try to talk to their sons are usually pointed to receive only short complaints in reply.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:While watching TV with others, women usually talk a lot because they \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:After a vacation with her girlfriend, a woman would talk to her again on the phone for hours so as to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What does the writer want to tell us most?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following would be the BEST title for the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/1txdc303273127.html"},

Setting a time limit(\u9650\u5236) often helps with this. Different ages decide different amounts of time. 10-15 minutes is good for a child that's aged 6-8. A time of 20-30 minutes is about right for a child aged 9-12. Kids can keep studying for 30-45 minutes from the ages of 13 to 15. This, of course, depends on your abilities to pay attention and stay on tasks.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:In the first paragraph, the writer mainly tells us that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: In the third paragraph, the writer wants to tell us that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The passage mainly tells children \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/3vlpc203273576.html"},

Many years later, the cocoa bean was brought to other countries and people came to love the taste of chocolate. \n\n In 1824, John Cadbury opened a small shop in Britain. One of the things he sold was chocolate drink. In 1831, he opened a factory to make chocolate drink. He wanted to encourage people to drink chocolate instead of other drinks. A few years later, a man called Joseph Fry found a way to make chocolate instead of only drinking it. But at that time chocolate was very expensive and only the rich people could buy it. Later, more and more chocolate bars were produced and sold, it became cheaper.\n\n However, at first only plain chocolate \uff08a kind of chocolate without milk and with very little sugar\uff09was produced. Milk chocolate came later and this was made by adding milk to the chocolate. The first milk chocolate bar was made in Cadbury's factory in 1897. Their most famous chocolate, Cadbury's Milk Bar, was made in 1905. It has been the most popular chocolate in Britain and around the world for over 100 years.

A half century ago in the United states, most people experienced strong and precise dividing lines between days of rest and days of work, school time and summer time. Today the dividing lines are still there, but they seem not clear.\n\nThe law in almost all states used to require stores to close on Sunday; in most, it no longer does. It used to keep the schools open in all seasons except summer, in most, it still does. And whether the work week should strengthen its legal\uff08\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\uff09limits, or whether it should become more changeable, is often debated\uff08\u4e89\u8bba\uff09. How should we, as a society, organize our time? Should we go even further in relaxing the dividing lines of time until we live in a world in which every minute is much like every other?\n\n These are not easy questions even to ask. Part of the difficulty is that we seldom recognize the \u201claw of time\u201d even when we meet it face to face.

When we turn the clock forward to start daylight \u2013 saving time, have we ever thought to ourselves: \u201cHere is the law in action\u201d? As we shall see, there is a lot of law that has great influence on how organize and use time: compulsory education law, overtime law, and daylight-saving law \u2013 as well as law about Sunday closing, holidays, being late to work, time zones, and so on.

You can visit many other countries or different parts of your country. Ships are not so fast as trains or planes, but traveling by sea is a very pleasant way to spend a holiday.\n\nMany people like to travel by car. You can make your own timetable. You can travel three or four hundred miles or only fifty or one hundred miles a day, just as you like. You can stop if there is something interesting, for example, at a good restaurant where you can enjoy a good meal, or at a hotel to spend the night.

Money and success alone do not bring lasting happiness. Aristotle, a Greek thinker, said, \"Happiness depends upon (\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e)ourselves.\" In other words, we make our own happiness. Here are a few suggestions\uff08\u5efa\u8bae\uff09 to help you be happier.\n\n The first secret of happiness is to enjoy the simple things in life. Too often, we spend so much time thinking about the future. For example, getting into college or getting a good job \uff0dthat we fail to enjoy the present. You should enjoy life's simple pleasures, such as reading a good book, listening to your favorite music, or spending time with close friends. People who have several close friends often live happier and healthier lives.\n\nAnother secret to living a happy life is to be active, and have hobbies where you forget your problems and time. Many people experience this dancing, or playing a sport, such as swimming. You can forget about your problems, and only think about the activity. \n\nFinally, many people find happiness in helping others. Studies show that people feel good when they spend their time helping others. If you want to feel happier, do good things for someone. You can help a friend with his or her studies, go shopping to buy food for an elderly person, or simply help out around the house by washing the dishes.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The best title of the passage is\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The passage gives us \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_pieces of advice on happiness.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The writer thinks that\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following is not mentioned\uff08\u63d0\u53ca\uff09in the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/i05oc203272435.html"},

This Christian holiday is not on the same date every year\uff0cbut it's always on a Sunday. It can be any Sunday between March 22 and April 25. Many people celebrate Easter by buying new clothes. Children celebrate by hunting for colored eggs that their parents have hidden around the house. People also give Easter baskets filled with candy and other goodies to one another to celebrate the day.\n\nBut the holiday is more than new clothes and good things to eat. On Easter, many people go to church to celebrate Jesus' resurrection\uff08\u590d\u6d3b\uff09from the dead. Most people color Ester eggs. Some people hide them. Others just eat them. But no matter what one does with Easter eggs\uff0cthey are an important Easter tradition across the Western world. People from many different cultures celebrate Easter. In both America and Belgium, children look for Easter eggs hidden on grass and in bushes(\u704c\u6728\u4e1b). In America, children believe the eggs are hidden by the Easter rabbit.But in Belgium, the hidden eggs are supposed to have fallen from church bells. In Bulgaria (\u4fdd\u52a0\u5229\u4e9a), red Easter eggs are lucky in churches. Bulgarian families also hit these Easter eggs together to see whose is the strongest. The winner looks forward to good fortune(\u8fd0\u6c14) that year. Still dozens of other Easter traditions exist.

Lots of stores and supermarkets sell DIY things. TV programs show people how to DIY.\n\n English people like DIY. There is a saying in UK---\u201cAn Englishman's home is his castle\u201d. Huge numbers of people spend their holidays making their homes beautiful \u201ccastles\u201d. If there is anything that needs fixing around their houses, such as painting the walls or putting in a new shower, they will do the jobs themselves. They share DIY experiences with their friends. More and more people have discovered the joy of DIY. Sometimes people also DIY for saving money. With the economic downturn at present, many people can not afford to buy a bigger house. They are looking at how they can make their houses better without spending a lot of money. It is not surprising that DIY is so popular.\n\n DIY can be difficult. There is a huge market for DIY furniture which people need to put together themselves with a few basic(\u57fa\u672c\u7684) tools (\u5de5\u5177). However, people often find it not easy to build a piece of furniture because they can't understand the instructions. Sometimes the instructions are simple and clear, but the furniture itself is difficult to build. One thing is for sure, though most DIY projects are started with the best intentions (\u76ee\u7684\uff0c\u610f\u56fe), many of them may not get finished. DIY can also be dangerous. For example, anything electrical should be done by a professional worker. Unluckily, many people don't care about this warning and put themselves in danger. It is reported that in just one year over 230 000 people were hurt while doing DIY in UK, including 41 000 who fell off ladders (\u68af\u5b50).\n\n Therefore, DIY can bring us fun and help us save money, but it is not always as easy as it is thought to be if \n\n.

However, many people don't smile because they think they have ugly teeth. For example, one of my classmates, Mike, doesn't have very nice teeth, so that is why he seldom opens his mouth. He even says that he has lost confidence because of his teeth. So it is very important for us to look after our teeth. In fact, a lot of people have this problem. Some people inherit teeth problems from their parents, while others' teeth are damaged because of bad habits, like heavy smoking, eating too much sugar or not brushing teeth often. If your teeth are in bad shape, you should see a dentist and ask for help. They can help improve your teeth and tell you how to take care of them.\n\nSmiling can help you to feel more confidence and make people think of you as a more friendly person. If you want to keep healthy, you should not only smile but also laugh.

During the free hours some of the teenagers learn photo taking or painting. Others sit around and talk or sing. Each teenager chooses his own way to spend his free time.\n\nWhen people live together, rules are necessary. In this programme the teenagers and the adults make the rules together. If someone breaks a rule, the problem goes before the whole group. They talk about it and ask, \u201cWhy did it happen? What should we do about it?\u201d\n\nOne of the teenagers has this to say about his experience, \u201cYou stop thinking only about yourself; you learn to think about the group.\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:In one special programme in New York State, young and older people \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ .\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:All the members work some time every day mainly to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ .\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Living together, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ .\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The last programme shows that the teenager thinks his experience in the programme is \\_\\_\\_\\_ .\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The best title for the passage is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ .\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/rn78c203271337.html"},

In most places, five houses or ten men can walk side by side. When you visit the Great Wall, you can't help wondering (\u7591\u60d1) how the Chinese people were able to build (\u5efa\u9020) such a great wall thousands of years ago. Without any modern machine (\u673a\u5668), it was really very difficult to build it. They had to do all the work by hand. It took millions of men hundreds of years to build it.\n\nThe Great Wall has a history of over two thousand years. The kings began to build the first parts of it around two thousand seven hundred years ago. Then, Qin Shihuang had all the walls joined up (\u8fde\u8d77\u6765).

He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never invited us to play in his yard, but he was a very kind person.\n\nWhen Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. He owned a large field and wanted to make it a forest.\n\nThe good doctor had some interesting ideas about planting trees. He never watered his new trees. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them, and that if you watered them, each baby tree would grow weaker and weaker, so you had to make things difficult for them and pick out the weaker trees early on.\n\nHe talked about how watering trees made for shallow\uff08\u6d45\u7684\uff09roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of water under the earth by themselves. Deep roots were very important.\n\nSo he never watered his trees. He'd planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he'd beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention.\n\nDr. Gibbs died several years after I left home. Every now and then, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I watched him plant about twenty-five years ago. They're very big and strong now.

According to a new study, a baby's cry can make adults react(\u53cd\u5e94) very quickly, even if they are not related.\n\n Oxford University researchers used the classic game whack-a-mole for the study.\u00a0 Whack-a-mole(\u6253\u9f39\u9f20\u6e38\u620f) requires people to hit one of nine buttons (\u6309\u94ae). The players must react as quickly as they can to whichever of the buttons lights up at random(\u968f\u673a). It is a game that requires speed and accuracy (\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6 ).\n\n The study included 40 men and women volunteers aged 19 to 59. Some of them had sons or daughters but none had a baby at the time. They played whack-a-mole after listening to different sounds, including babies crying, the crying of adults in trouble and birdsong played at a similar pitch to the babies' cries.\n\n The volunteers' scores were higher after listening to the sound of crying babies. Men and women had similar scores overall. The results showed that a crying baby gets special attention.\n\n \"Few sounds make people react quite like the cry of a baby,\" said Morten Kringelbach of Oxford's psychiatry\uff08\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u5b66\uff09 department, who led the study. \"For example, it's almost impossible to ignore(\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u4e0d\u7406) crying babies on planes. This is true even though there are so many other noises around.\"\u00a0\n\nHe added that a baby's cry can increase adults' heart rate and blood pressure. This is understandable, because in the course of human evolution (\u8fdb\u5316), taking care of babies has always been an important job for adults. When a baby is hungry or feeling bored or unwell, it will cry. As a result, human brains and bodies develop a special reaction to a baby's cry. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The game \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d shows \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:\u201cWhack-a-mole\u201d requires people to hit \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ at a time.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:According to the passage, a baby's cry \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:From the last paragraph, we learn that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n\u5c0f\u98985:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/w44nc303270885.html"},

I told him honestly why I wanted the job----I needed to keep my family in Boston. My wife recently died of a heart attack. A job in Boston would help me reduce some of the extreme trauma (\u7cbe\u795e\u521b\u4f24) and pain of the loss for\u00a0my 16-year-old daughter. It was important for me to keep her in her high school. I could still hardly talk about the loss of my wife.\n\nBruce, the interviewer, was politely empathetic, but he didn't probe any further. He admitted my loss and with great respect, moved on to another subject. After the next round of the interview, Bruce took me to lunch with another person. Then he asked me to take a walk with him. He told me that he, too, had lost his wife. And, like me, he had also been married 20 years and had three children.\n\nIn his sharing, I realized that he had experienced the same pain as I had -----a pain that was almost impossible to explain to someone who had not lost a beloved one. He offered his business card and home phone number and suggested that, if I need help or just want someone to talk to, I should feel free to give him a call.\n\nWhether I got the job or not, he wanted me to know that he was there if I ever needed help. When he had no idea if we would ever see each other again, he helped our family deal with one of the greatest losses.

There is a huge market for DIY furniture which people need to get together themselves with a few basic tools.

Sometimes the instructions are simple and clear, but the furniture itself is difficult to build. One thing is for sure, though most DIY projects are started with the best intentions. Many of them may not get finished. DIY can also be dangerous. For example, anything electrical should be done by a professional worker. Unluckily, many people don't care about this warning and put themselves in danger. It is reported that in just one year over 230,000 people were hurt while doing DIY in UK, including 41,000 who fell off ladders.\n\nTherefore , DIY can bring us fun and help us save money, but it is not always as easy as it is thought to be if we bite off more than we can chew.

You probably know the rules of a library. You know you should respect and be nice to your classmates. But do you have music manners?\n\nKeep It Down! You have to notice the \n\n of your music. You should not play your music so loud that everyone around you can hear it. Some people might even get angry. Usually, when you play the music loud on an MP3 player, other people can't hear the words of the song. They just hear a loud sound. No one wants to listen to this. Very loud music can also be bad for your ears. So even if you are alone when listening to our MP3 players, you shouldn't turn it up too high.\n\nTake Them Off! You need to know when to turn your MP3 off and put it away. Libraries, and schools don't allow MP3 players. There are other places, like museums, that don't have rules, but it would be rude to have your MP3 player on. Sometimes, it doesn't make sense to listen on your MP3 player at event. Why would you listen to music at a play, a movie or a sporting event? You would miss what is going on and others would wonder why you even came.\n\nTake One Out! Once in a while it's okay just to take out one earphone and not other. Imagine you are listening on your MP3 player when someone asks you the way. It would not be rude to take out one earphone, tell him the way, and put back the earphone and continue listening. You can also do this when you order food at a fast-food restaurant or when you answer the telephone and it's not for you.\n\nIt's Your Choice! There are times when you need to decide what is best. For example, some people can listen to music on their MP3 players when reading books, while others think it is disturbing. In cases like this, you need to do what seems right for you.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The underlined word \u201cvolume\u201d in Paragraph Two probably means \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:No one wants to listen to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ from others' MP3 players.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:We should turn down the music when we are alone because loud music \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:If we listen to our MP3 player at a play, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:We can take one earphone out when we \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98986:It's all right to use our MP3 player in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98987:What can be the best title of this passage? \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n\u5c0f\u98986:C\n\u5c0f\u98987:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/u6ipc303269782.html"},

How will you escape? Do you know how to save yourself? Please read the following passage. \n\nEscaping a fire is a serious matter. Knowing what to do during a fire can save you life. It is important to know the ways you can use and show them to everyone in the family, such as stairways and fire escapes, but not lifts. \n\nFrom the lower floors of the buildings, escaping through windows is possible, learn the best way of leaving by windows with the least chance of serious injury. \n\nThe second floor window is usually not very high from the ground. An average(\u5e73\u5747\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684) person, hanging by the finger-tips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground. It is about the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way than to stay in a burning building. \n\nWindows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed. Or smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may leaked(\u6e17) into the room.\n\nOn a second or third floor, the best windows for escape are those that open onto a roof. From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely. Dropping onto cement(\u6c34\u6ce5) might end in injury. Bushes(\u704c\u6728\u4e1b) and grass can help to break a fall. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:\u9605\u8bfb\u77ed\u6587\uff0c\u8865\u5168\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u6bcf\u7a7a\u4e00\u8bcd\n\nThe passage mainly tells us how to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ from the lower floors of the building.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:\u9605\u8bfb\u77ed\u6587\uff0c\u8865\u5168\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u6bcf\u7a7a\u4e00\u8bcd\n\nFrom the passage we know we can't use \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ to leave a burning building\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:\u9605\u8bfb\u77ed\u6587\uff0c\u5c06\u5212\u7ebf\u53e5\u5b50\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u6c49\u8bed\u3002\n\nKeep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may leaked(\u6e17) into the room.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:\u8bcd\u7ec4break a fall\u5728\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u6c49\u8bed\u610f\u601d\u662f\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7b54\u684810\u8bcd\u4ee5\u5185\n\nWhat should we do to escape if an earthquake happens ?

Is it because of my clothes or my hair?\" she wondered. Almost every day during the first week, Anna stayed alone, thinking that there must have been something wrong with her or that nobody saw her at all!\n\nWhat caused Anna's problem? The reason was that nobody knew her. Most people don't like talking with strangers (\u964c\u751f\u4eba). So it's your job to volunteer to make contact with people who you want to know. The easiest way to catch their attention is to notice them first. Make eye contact with them and smile at them. When you smile at them, you are doing your best to show your kindness to them, and they are sure to understand that you are saying, \"Hey, how's everything going?\" In this way, you are taking the first step towards the road to friendship.\n\nWhen Anna realized this, she started talking to her classmates.

Not caring about the\u00a0 money, parents often send their children to the best schools or even abroad to England, the United States and Australia. They also want their children to take extra-course activities where they will either learn a musical instrument or ballet, or other classes which will give them a head in life. The Chinese believe that the more expensive an education is, the better it is. So parents will spend an unreasonable amount of money on education. Even poor couples will buy a computer for their son or daughter. However, what most parents fail to see is that the best early education they can give their children is usually very cheap.\n\nParents can see that their children are very skilled in some areas while poor in others. What most parents fail to realize though, is that today's children are short of self-respect and self-confidence.\n\nThe problem is that parents are only educating their children on how to take multiple-choice tests and how to study well, but parents are not teaching them the most important skills that they need to be confident, happy and clever.\n\nParents can achieve this by teaching practical skills like cooking, sewing and doing other housework. Teaching a child to cook will improve many of the skills that he will need later in life. Cooking requires patience and time. It is an enjoyable but difficult experience. A good cook always tries to improve his cooking, so he will learn to work hard and finish his job successfully step by step. His result, a well-cooked dinner, will give him much satisfaction and lots of self-confidence.\n\nSome old machines, such as a broken radio or TV set that you give your child to play with will make him curious and arouse(\u6fc0\u53d1) his interest. He will spend hours looking at them, trying to fix them; your child might become an engineer when he grows up. These activities are not only teaching a child to read a book, but rather to think, to use his mind. And that is more important.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:.

They like to see the children being busy with activities that are controlled by adults, but children don't know what to do when they are in danger. Even something like crossing a small river seems to be a hard challenge. Children are not comfortable with danger. Even small danger like getting their feet wet or falling down seems very terrible to them.\n\nMany people think the survival activities are good for children.

You can see the country you are traveling through. Modern trains have comfortable seats and dining-cars. \n\nmake even the longest journey enjoyable.\n\nSome people prefer to travel by sea when possible. There are large planes and river boats. You can visit many other countries and different parts of your country on them. Ships are not as fast as trains or planes, but traveling by sea is a very pleasant way to spend a holiday.\n\nMany people like to travel by car. You can make your own timetable. You can travel three or four hundred miles or only fifty or one hundred miles a day, just as you like. You can stop wherever you wish --- where there is something interesting to see, at a good restaurant where you can enjoy a good meal, or at a hotel where you can spend the night. That is why traveling by car is a popular pleasant trip, while people usually take a train or a plane when they are traveling on business.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:From the passage (\u77ed\u6587), we know the fastest way of traveling is \\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:If we travel by car, we can \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The underlined (\u5212\u7ebf\u7684) word \u201cThey\u201d in the passage refers to (\u6307\u7684\u662f)\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:When people travel on business, they usually take \\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985: How many ways of traveling are mentioned (\u88ab\u63d0\u5230\u7684) in the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c1/201408/u1v9c103267351.html"},

And I have a brother called Mike.\u00a0\n\nOne day, my brother called me and asked me for some advice. He was trying to decide between two job offers:\n\nJob 1 \u2013 The first job was your typical 40 hour a week \u201coffice\u201d job.\n\nJob 2 \u2013 The second job was more of a career in the insurance industry(\u4fdd\u9669\u4e1a), where he would start at the bottom, and after many years and many long hours eventually rise to the top (if he was good).\u00a0\n\nThe second job did not pay as well as the first job (at the beginning), but the pay-off of the second job (in the future) was much greater than the first job. So which job should my brother take? Well the answer is\u2026it depends.\n\nJust like the Cat was trying to tell Alice, which road you take depends a great deal on where you want to end up.\n\nBegin with the End in Mind\n\nI asked my brother what was his life's purpose. He said his purpose was to \u201cteach,\u201d but he wanted to make a lot of money first. I told my brother to forget about the money, and I advised him to focus on his purpose. I then asked him which job best supported his end result of \u201cteaching.\u201d He said the first job best supported his goal because he would only have to work 40 hours a week, which would give him spare time to teach. He continued on to say, \u201cbut if I take job number two, I can work hard and make more money, then I can retire early and \u201cteach\u201d later in life.\u201d I again advised him to \u201cfocus\u201d on his purpose, not money. Things don't end wrong, they begin wrong!\n\nYou Can't Ride Two Horses Well\n\nIt would be very difficult to have a successful teaching career while you're working 70-80 hours a week in the insurance business; no one can ride two horses well. As they say, you can do anything, but not everything. I advised him to get started today by choosing the job that best supported that decision.\n\nTomorrow Never Comes\n\nMy brother was thinking that he could always start teaching later in life, but the reality is, tomorrow never comes. Unless you decide right now to follow your feelings, they will probably never be completed. You only live once, don't go to the end of your life with one regret.\n\nThe Money Will Come\n\nMy brother seemed to be overly concerned with making money. I told him not to be anxious about making money. You will always have greater money when you're doing what you love. \n\nIn a word, whenever you're at a cross-road, be sure to make the decision that best supports the goal of your life. If you do, then you will be well on your way.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: Mike \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ David one day.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: Mike was trying to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:As for the life's purpose, Mike \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984: You Can't Ride Two Horses Well means \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985: The best title of the passage is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98981:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/qvguc303267482.html"},

If another ship does not come and help them and they do not have enough food or water, they will die.\n\nMost people believe we must not drink sea water. They believe that if we do, we shall be very ill because of all the salt in the water. A doctor called Alain Bombard did not believe this. He thought that people could stay alive by drinking sea water and eating small fish, animals and plants from the sea. On 19 October 1953, he set out in a small boat to cross the Atlantic Ocean(\u5927\u897f\u6d0b). He did not take any food or water with him.\n\nEvery day Dr. Bombard drank just a little sea water. He also caught fish and they had water in them. He drank this water. He could not cook the fish, so he ate them as they were. He took small plants from the sea, which gave him more food.\n\nDr. Bombard became hot, tired and quite ill, but after 65days at sea he was still alive.

He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly.\n\nIn fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling(\u722c\u884c) around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly.\n\nThe man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid(\u6db2\u4f53) from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly.\n\nSometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives.

You may spend time with a friend and get to see where he lives. So remember to be polite.\n\nWhen to arrive\n\nThe first thing to remember is that when a friend invites you, you need to arrive on time. If your friend tells you to come \u201caround 3:00\u201d, that means you can turn up a little bit after 3:00. But usually it is a good idea to arrive at the right time. \n\nWhat to bring\n\nOften it is also nice to bring something to your friend's house. This could be a box of chocolates for you two to share, or maybe a movie that you can watch together. You can also bring some flowers. A little gift is a nice way to show your friend that you are excited to be at his house. \n\nHow to greet (\u95ee\u5019)\n\nWhen you visit your friend's house, you may also meet his parents. You should tell them who you are and they may tell you their names. As a child, I went to visit my friend Paul. I called his parents by their first names John and Mary. But now I know it is more polite to call them Mr. or Mrs. Smith. This will show them more respect (\u5c0a\u91cd) and then they may tell you to call them by their first names. Another way to show respect is to call them Madam or Sir.\u00a0\n\nIt is a cool thing to visit a friend's house. Be polite to your friend and your friend's parents, and you will be invited again!\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: If you are told to get to your friend's house around 5:00 p.m., it is polite to arrive at\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:When the writer was a child, he called his friend's father \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The passage mainly (\u4e3b\u8981) tells us \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98981:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/vu1bc303266217.html"},

However, there is still some advice for you to follow.\n\n First, look at why you do it. In other words, what's the result of doing this thing? If your bad habit is shouting at people when you are unhappy or under pressure, what do you get from it? It may make you feel a little better for the moment.

What are you losing because of your habit? Shouting at other people is a bad habit because it makes people around you feel bad and unhappy. Leaving your homework undone is a bad habit because you may be punished by your teacher. Having more Internet time means that you are losing the chance to learn the things that you need to learn. When you think that way, you'll find that it's not wise to keep your bad habit! Now it is time to make a decision. What will you choose?

They want you to grow up \\_\\_41\u25b2\\_\\_ and happily.\n\nSo how can you \\_\\_42\u25b2\\_\\_ things easier on yourself? It's easier \\_\\_43\u25b2\\_\\_ you think. Just let your parents know what you're doing. Get them to know your friends. Call them if you stay somewhere else \\_\\_44\u25b2\\_\\_ than usual. Say \\_\\_45\u25b2\\_\\_ to them when you are wrong. Take responsibility(\u8d23\u4efb) for what you have done. Talk about your ideas with them. They may talk about \\_\\_46\u25b2\\_\\_ with you. Most of all, try \\_\\_47\u25b2\\_\\_ them. They are still \\_\\_48\u25b2\\_\\_ being parents and need your help, too. Someday, when you become a parent, they may give you \\_\\_49\u25b2\\_\\_ on how to get on with your \\_\\_50\u25b2\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98981:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/r88pc203265466.html"},

But they didn't say even one word to each other. I told them about Tommy's schoolwork and behaviour. I hoped to help them see what they were doing to their son. But it looked that my words didn't work. I thought that maybe Tommy could tell them something himself.\n\n I found Tommy's paper in the back of his desk. Tommy has written some words on it many times. I gave the paper to Tommy's mother. She read it and gave it to his father. He read it and his face became soft(\u67d4\u548c\u7684). He reached for his wife's hand. She smiled up at him. My eyes were with tears. He helped her with her coat and they left together.\n\n I picked the paper up and looked at it again. It read: \u201cDear Mommy\u2026 Dear Daddy\u2026 I love you.\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: Why did the teacher call a meeting with Tommy's parents?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:.

Some mothers store their breast milk (\u6bcd\u4e73) in banks.\n\nThere are ten breast milk banks across the United States, where mothers can donate their extra milk for other women's babies.\n\nExperts say breast milk is the best food for babies. The World Health Organization says it is the only food babies should get during the first six months of life, in most cases. Breast milk is especially important for babies born too early. Sometimes these premature babies must stay in the hospital for many weeks.\n\nJames Cameron is a doctor who treats newborns at Lutheran Children's Hospital in Fort Wayne,   Indiana. He says breast milk is almost like medicine. Doctor James Cameron says, \u201cThe fact is that there are so many different proteins and specialized sugars in the breast milk that the mom's able to make that help provide immunity (\u514d\u75ab\u529b). It's very important for the health of the newborn.\u201d\n\nLucy Baur lives near Fort Wayne. She breastfed both her children and always had more milk than they needed. She wanted to donate to the Indiana Mothers Milk Bank in   Indianapolis. But freezing and shipping milk can be costly. Then, a donor station opened near her home.\n\nMilk donations in the United States work like this. Donors must be willing to provide almost three liters of breast milk. They freeze the milk and take it to the station. There, employees warm the milk and mix it with other mothers' milk. Then, the milk is heated to kill bacteria. After that, the technicians test samples of all the milk to make sure it is safe and healthful. The milk is re-frozen and sent to the main milk bank. The milk bank transports the milk to hospitals to feed premature or sick babies.\n\nDonors are tested for diseases before any milk is accepted. They are not permitted to smoke tobacco, use illegal drugs or drink too much alcohol.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to the passage, which thing can also be stored in banks except money, jewels and important documents?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:From the text we learn \n\n.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983: The breast milk is important for newborns because \n\n.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984: Who is allowed to donate her extra milk of the following women?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The purpose of setting up breast milk banks is to \n\n.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n\u5c0f\u98985:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/im1lc303291928.html"},

Some are big, others are small. Big ones have two or three doors. Such refrigerators can not only keep the food cold and fresh, but also make ice and freeze the food. However, small ones usually have one door and can only keep things cold and fresh.\n\nThere are also refrigerators that are friendly to the environment. In the 1970s, the world was in energy crisis(\u5371\u673a). Refrigerators use too much energy. So people began to think of ways to improve it . At last a kind of new refrigerator was made. They use very little energy, but they're too expensive. They cost twice or three times more than the ones that we use at home. However, people believe they will be cheaper and cheaper. As a result, they will be more and more popular.\n\nIn the future, there will be refrigerators that can do more than we can imagine. They are called smart refrigerators(\u667a\u80fd\u51b0\u7bb1) .

And a cell phone can give kids almost instant access(\u5feb\u6377\u901a\u9053) to their parents if something goes wrong or they need help. It can give parents quick access to their kids so they can check on them and make sure they're OK.\n\nIf you do get a cell phone, make some rules with your parents, such as how many minutes you're allowed to spend on the phone, when you can use your phone, when the phone must be turned off, and what you will do if someone calls you too often, and so on.\n\nYou'll also have to learn to take care of the phone in your life.

Parking is usually free, and the weather inside is always fine. The newest malls have beautiful rest places with waterfalls and large green trees.\n\nThe largest mall in the United States is the Mall of America in Minnesota. It covers 4. 2 million square feet\uff08\u82f1\u5c3a\uff09. It has 350 stores, eight nightclubs, and a large park! There are parking spaces for 12,750 cars. About 750,000 people shop there every week.\n\nThe first indoor mall in the United States was built in 1965 in Edina Minnesota. People love doing all their shopping in one place. More malls are built around the country. Now malls are like town centers where people come to do many things. They shop, of course, they also eat in food courts\uff08\u5e7f\u573a\uff09that have food from all over the world. They see films at theaters. Some people even get their exercise by doing the new sport of \u201cmall walking\u201d. Others go to malls to meet friends.\n\nIn some malls, people can see a doctor and even go to the church.

His Aunt Polly told him to paint the fence\uff08\u7bf1\u7b06\uff09around the garden. It was ninety feet long and nine feet high. He felt very blue. \n\nThen he had a wonderful idea. He picked up his brush and started to work. \n\nSoon Ben came along the road. He was happily eating an apple. He stopped to look at Tom. Tom went on painting and pretended\uff08\u5047\u88c5\uff09not to see Ben. \n\n\u201cI'm going swimming,\u201d said Ben. \u201cDo you want to go swimming, Tom? But I guess you can't.

Does a boy get a chance to paint a fence like this every day?\u201d \n\nBen thought about this. Tom continued painting carefully. Sometimes he stopped, stood back to look at the fence like an artist, and then added\uff08\u589e\u52a0\uff09a bit more paint in just the right place. Ben was watching Tom paint with great interest. He was getting more and more eager\uff08\u6e34\u671b\u7684\uff09to have a try himself. \n\nAfter a while, Ben asked Tom if he would let him paint a little. Tom thought about it, and said, \u201cNo, Ben, I can't. You see. Aunt Polly wants it to be done well. Aunt Polly said that I must paint it with great care.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, please, Tom,\u201d begged Ben. \u201cI can do it. I'll be really careful. Just let me try. I'll give you half of my apple. Well, I'll give you all of it!\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, all right, Ben,\u201d said Tom. \u201cYou must be very careful.\u201d \n\nHe gave Ben his brush with worry on his face but joy in his heart. He sat down under the tree, and started to eat Ben's apple. All day, boys came to make fun of Tom, but they ended up staying to paint. When Ben got tired, Billy was waiting. He gave Tom a kite for a chance to paint. Then Johnny offered him a basketball, and so on. \n\nBy late afternoon Tom had got all kinds of toys, and the fence had got three coats of paint. Later Aunt Polly came to look at the painted fence.

But uncertainty is really another word for chance.\n\n When Allison graduated from Harvard, she had chances all over the place but had no idea what she wanted to do. She took a job in consulting\uff08\u54a8\u8be2\uff09, but she knew she wouldn't stay there. She took the GRE and scored so high that she was able to increase her income\uff08\u6536\u5165\uff09by teaching students. Still, she didn't think she wanted to go to graduate school. Allison knew she wasn't doing what she wanted, but she didn't know what she wanted.\n\n She worried. All her friends were going to graduate school or starting their own businesses. She was lost and felt that she would never find anything out. After six years, Allison, by having a general\uff08\u5168\u9762\u7684\uff09plan in mind, got married, moved to the Midwest, and used her consulting experience to get a great job. Allison realized that she spent her years finding her way: time well spent, and time we must all take if we're being honest with ourselves.\n\n The only way to lead an interesting life is to face uncertainty and make a choice. Otherwise your life is not your own\u2014it is a path someone else has chosen. Moments of uncertainty are when you create your life, when you become who you are. Uncertainty usually begins with a job hunt, but it doesn't end there. Every new role we take on means another round of uncertainty.

The movie is about two lovers who are separated(\u5206\u79bb) and finally die during Worid War II. Before and after the movie, the students were asked questions measuring(\u8861\u91cf) how happy they were with their lives. Researchers also asked them before, afier and three times during the movie to measure various emotions, including sadness.\n\n Researchers found that the sadder students felt while watching the movie, the more likely they were to think about real people they had close relationships with in life.

Being open is a kind of invitation to others to come in, to speak and to share. It is important in letting others get to know how we think and feel. In this way we will be understood and accepted by others. If we aren't open with others, we won't fully believe in ourselves or others.\n\nHere are a few ways for you to be more open. First, make your outside behavior the same with your inside feelings and thoughts. Second, share how you really feel about something instead of just opinions. Third, try to change your questions into statements(\u9648\u8ff0\u53e5) and talk in the first person so that people will understand you more easily. For example, you might say, \u201cI feel happy that you're here,\u201d instead of, \u201cAre you glad that you're here?\u201d Finally, try not to say, \u201cI don't know.\u201d This usually means I don't want to think about it any more.\n\nRemember also that it is not suitable to be open with everyone in every situation. You may want to be more open with close friends, but not with people you don't know well, because you are not sure how someone else will use what they know about you. Besides, some people may not be used to too much openness. If we say everything we feel or think to them, they will feel very uncomfortable at times.\n\nIn all, being open is a good way for us to get on well with other people, but we'd better keep the balance between being open and not being too open.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:Invite\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98982:how/what\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98983:accept\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98984:Ways\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98985:sure \n\u5c0f\u98986:real/true\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98987:questions\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98988:information\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98989:sometimes\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u989810:make/help\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/mkeyc303282185.html"},

At the beginning hikers should start with walks that they can do in one day. As you get stronger, you can go on overnight hikes. Later you can go longer than that. You can make your hiking last (\u6301\u7eed) a few days or weeks.\n\nFor safety (\u5b89\u5168), hikers should hike with someone. You should have one or two friends with you. It is also a good idea to carry a map.\n\nBackpacking is another kind of hiking. People carry food, clothes and other things on their backs in packs.

As a result, no one knew who I was. I was very lonely, and afraid to make friends with anyone,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEvery time I heard the other students talking and laughing, I felt my heart break.I couldn't talk to anyone about my problem, and I didn't want my parents to worry about me.\n\n Then one day, my classmates talked happily with their friends, but I sat at my desk unhappily as usual. At that moment, a boy entered the classroom. I didn't know who he was. He passed me and then turned back. He looked at me and, without a word, smiled.\n\n Suddenly, I felt the touch of something bright and friendly. It made me feel happy, \n\nlively and warm.\n\n That smile changed my life. I started to talk with the other students and made friends. Day by day, I became closer to everyone in my class. The boy with the lucky smile has become my best friend now.\n\n One day, I asked him why he smiled, but he couldn't remember smiling at me! It doesn't matter because all the dark days have gone. Now I believe that the world is what you think it is. If you think you are lonely, you might always be alone. So smile at the world and it will smile back.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What was the important gift ?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Where did the story take place?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:How did the writer feel when the boy smiled at her?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:How did the smile chang her life?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Why is it called A beautiful smile?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \n\n", "answer": "71.

And many teenagers find that earning their own money gives them a sense of pride and freedom.\n\nThe US Department of Labor allows teenagers to apply for jobs at the age of 14. Popular part-time jobs include working in ice cream stores, coffee shops, and clothing stores. During the school year, teenagers may go to work a few times a week after their classes get out, then work for longer on the weekends.\n\nIn the summer, top jobs for teens include working at camps, swimming pools and amusement parks. These jobs are great for young people who want to be active and have fun while making money.\n\nA favorite job for many teens is babysitting(\u4e34\u65f6\u66ff\u4eba\u770b\u5c0f\u5b69), and they can start before 14 if the parents agree. After the children are sleeping and before the parents come home, babysitters have lots of freedom.\n\nAs long as they stay in the house and make sure the kids are okay, babysitters can do their homework, enjoy a snack, watch TV, or talk on the phone with friends.\n\nIt can be stressful to balance school, homework, and a part-time job.

Among them are many kinds of useful ways as well as taking special care of your health.\n\nIt is important that you make yourself excited to make your memory more active. You can do this by doing some new activities and by changing your daily habits. Learning a new skill helps your brain(\u5927\u8111) to develop. When trying to remember something, you should pay special attention to the most important things about it. Do not allow other thoughts to enter your mind because this will reduce your chances of making right memories.\n\nAn excellent way to help memory is to connect information with pictures. Try to see the pictures in your mind. Taking notes and keeping a diary will also be helpful.\n\nHealthy food and plenty of vitamins are necessary for your memory to work well. Drinking a lot of water also helps keep your memory. You must allow your brain to have enough sleep and rest. When you are sleep, Your brain stores memory. Not enough sleep can cause problems with storing information. And being tired will also stop you from being able to think clearly and well.\n\nIn order to keep your mind on your work, you must be free from worry. Generally keeping fit and normal health checks are both important as well--- not just for improving your memory.\n\n\u6839\u636e\u77ed\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\u5b8c\u6210\u8868\u683c\u3002\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:improve\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98982:ways\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98983:care\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98984:part\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98985:important\n\u5c0f\u98986:make\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98987:pictures\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98988:keeping\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98989:healthy\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u989810:enough\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/01kec303280220.html"},

You should not play your music so loud that everyone around you can hear it. Some people might even get angry. Usually, when you play the music loud on an MP3 player, other people can't hear the words of the song. They just hear a loud sound. Not one wants to listen to this.

You need to know when to turn your MP3 player off and put it away. Libraries and schools don't allow MP3 players. There are other places, like museums, that don't have rules, but it would be rude to have your MP3 player on. Sometimes, it just doesn't make sense to listen to your MP3 player at event. Why would you listen to music at a play, a movie or a sporting event? You would miss what is going on and others would wonder why you even came.\n\nTake one out! Sometimes it's okay just to take out one earphone and not the other. Imagine you are listening to your MP3 player when someone asks you the way. It would not be rude to take out one earphone, tell him the way, and put back the earphone and continue listening. You can also do this when you order food at a fast-food restaurant or when you answer the telephone and it's not for you.\n\nIt's your choice! There are times when you need to decide what is best.

The children ran the family when their mother was absent. All three of Bobby's sisters had already made beautiful gifts for their mother. \n\nIt was Christmas Eve already, and he had nothing. Bobby started to walk down to the street. He walked from shop to shop. Everything seemed so beautiful and so far away. It was getting dark. Suddenly he found a shiny dime (\u4e00\u89d2\u786c\u5e01) on the ground. Never has anyone felt so wealthy as Bobby did at the moment. It was enough to buy a rose with one dime. \n\nHe went inside a flower shop. When the owner asked if he could help him, Bobby took out the dime and asked if he could buy one flower. The shop owner looked at Bobby, then said, \u201cYou just wait here and I'll see what I can do for you.\u201d\n\nThe shop owner returned holding a dozen of red roses in his hand. Bobby's heart sank (\u4e0b\u6c89) as the owner put them gently into a long white box. \u201cThat will be a dime, young man,\u201d said the shop owner, reaching out his hand for the dime.

Even now people still agree with him. \n\n. Without other people, life became empty and sad. We all need friends.\n\nFor some of us, though making friends is not difficult, feeling shy, we may not want to make the first move. It is also difficult at times to keep the friends we already have.\n\nThere are many books about friendship, but Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence\u00a0 People, written in 1936, is the most famous. This \u201chow to\u201d book about getting along with other people became a best-seller. It was later put into 28 languages.\n\nDale Carnegie's advice seems to be simple, but can his advice help you? Do you need to change the way you act? Here is the list of advice from his book.\n\n1. Be friendly and polite. Always greet with a smile. Begin with \u201cexcuse me\u201d or \u201cwould you please\u201d, when you want to ask somebody. Remember to say \u201cthank you\u201d and try to be as helpful as you can.\n\n2. Go out of your way to be nice. Find some time to do special things for other people. Making some soup for a sick neighbor may seem like a little thing to you, but it will make your neighbor feel a lot better.\n\n3. Remember names. They say that the sweetest music to a person's ears is the sound of his or her own name.\n\n4. Be open-minded. Try to understand other people's ways and ideas and learn something from them.\n\n5. Listen patiently. When someone is talking to you, look at him or her, listen carefully and say something when necessary.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The underlined sentence \u201cNo one can live a completely isolated life\u201d means \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d in this passage. \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Some of us feel it not easy to make friends because \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:We can learn from this passage that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following is NOT mentioned in Carnegie's book? \n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The best possible title for this passage should be \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/ph0pc303279015.html"},

Every pupil at Writhlinton School is being offered their own laptop (\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111) to use in class and for homework.\n\nBuildings with wireless (\u65e0\u7ebf\u7684) systems will open soon. The laptop project will cost the school about \u00a3400,000. Parents are being asked to pay \u00a32 per week for their children's laptop as long as the child stays at the school. Those unable to pay will receive economic aid (\u7ecf\u6d4e\u63f4\u52a9).\n\nThe headmaster, Will Roberts, says parents think it is a \u201cbargain (\u5212\u7b97\u7684\u4e70\u5356)\u201d because it's expensive to buy a laptop. \n\n\u201cWith the help of the laptop, any time they want to learn, they can. Pupils, who are aged between 11 and 18, can complete homework by connecting to the school servers (\u670d\u52a1\u5668) from home. And their work can be marked at once and teachers share pupils' work away from the classroom.\u201d\n\nMr. Roberts insists, however, that children will continue to use traditional learning materials. \u201cThere will always be a place for traditional writing and textbooks here,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we want to prepare our pupils for the real world.\u201d\n\nThe project was started with the help of the government-supported charity, the e-Learning Foundation (\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u53f0\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a).

Sometimes he stopped, stood back to look at the fence like an artist, and then added a bit more paint in just the right place. Ben was watching Tom paint with great interest. He was getting more and more eager to have a try himself.\n\nAfter a while, Ben asked Tom if he would let him paint a little. Tom thought about it, and said,\n\n\u201cNo, Ben, I can't. You see. Aunt Polly wants it to be done well. Aunt Polly said that I must paint it with great care.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, please, Tom,\u201d begged Ben. \u201cI can do it. I'll be really careful.

He sat down under the tree, and started to eat Ben's apple. All day, boys came to make fun of Tom, but they ended up staying to paint. When Ben got tired, Billy was waiting. He gave Tom a kite for a chance to paint. Then Johnny offered him twelve marbles, and so on.\n\nBy late afternoon Tom had gained all sorts of toys, and the fence had gained three\u00a0 coats of paint.

She had left the black umbrella above her seat in the compartment\uff08\u8f66\u53a2\uff09, but when she got back, it had gone! When she had left the compartment, there had been no other passengers\uff08\u4e58\u5ba2\uff09 in it, but now there were three.\n\nSally began to cry when she saw that the umbrella was no longer there. The other passengers felt very sorry for her and asked what the matter was. She told them that the black umbrella she had bought for her mother was gone, and that she had to get out at the next station. After the three other passengers heard it, they asked her for her mother's address so that they could sent the umbrella to her if someone had taken it by mistake and brought it back after Sally had got out of the train.\n\nThe next week, Sally heard from her mother. It said, \u201cThank you very much for your lovely presents, but why did you send me three black umbrellas?\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Which of the following is the best for the sentence \u201cYou could carry that when you are wearing clothes of any color?\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does the story infer\uff08\u63a8\u65ad\uff09?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:How many umbrellas did Sally's mother get at last?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The best name of the story is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:What does the writer want to tell us?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n\u5c0f\u98985:B \n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/mrftc203277890.html"},

This is how the story went: \n\n An old man lived in a certain part of London, and he would wake up every morning and go to the sub-way. He would \n\nthe train right to Central London, and then sit at the street corner and \n\n He would do this every single day of his life. He sat at\n\n\u00a0street corner and begged for almost 20 years\n\n His\n\nwas dirty, and a stench came out and it smelled terrible. The neighbors could not stand the smell any more, so they called for the police officers to clear the place. The officers knocked down the door and cleaned the house. There were small bags of\n\nall over the house \n\n\u00a0he had collected over the years. \n\n The police counted the money, and they soon \n\n\u00a0that the old man was a millionaire. They waited outside his house expecting to \\_\\_\\_\n\n\\_\\_ the good news with him. When the old man arrived home that evening, one of the officers told him that there was no need for him to beg any more as he was a \n\n\u00a0man now, a millionaire. \n\n But the old man said \n\n\u00a0; he went into his house and locked the door. The next morning he woke up \n\nwent to the subway, sat at the street corner and continued to beg. \n\n Clearly, this old man had no great plans,\n\n\u00a0or anything significant for his life. We learn nothing from this story other than staying focused on the things we enjoy doing. \n\n\u5c0f\u989812:A. rich\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B. poor\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C nice\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 D. bad\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n\u5c0f\u98985:D\n\u5c0f\u98986:C\n\u5c0f\u98987:A\n\u5c0f\u98988:B\n\u5c0f\u98989:A\n\u5c0f\u989810:C\n\u5c0f\u989811:B\n\u5c0f\u989812:A\n\u5c0f\u989813:C\n\u5c0f\u989814:D\n\u5c0f\u989815:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/you4c303278129.html"},

Do you know how it came about?\n\nThe tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added(\u589e\u52a0) hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose (\u6563\u7684) tea again.\n\nSullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze (\u8584\u7eb1) and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags.\n\nHowever, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea.\u00a0 This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Who invented the tea bag?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The tea in silk bags was welcome because\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The material of the tea bags is usually\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_now.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The underlined sentence \"Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK\" probably means \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_in the UK\u201d.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The reading mainly talks about\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n\u5c0f\u98985:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/979sc203277418.html"},

The middle school is going to use a new way to decide who the top students are. The best students won't only have high marks. They will also be kids who don't smoke, drink or dye (\u67d3) their hair. The following are some of the new rules.\n\nTell the truth. Have you ever copied someone else's work on an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something that an honest student should do. If you have played computer games for two hours in your room, don't tell your parents you have done homework.\n\nDo more at school. Good students love animals and care for other people. April is Bird Loving Month in China. Is your school doing anything to celebrate it? You should join! That way, you can learn more about animals and how to protect them. When more people work together, it is more fun for everyone.\n\nHave you fought with your teammates when your basketball team lost? Only working together can make your team stronger. Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself.\n\nBe open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll discover Earth II someday. Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them because new ideas make life better for everyone.\n\nProtect yourself. Has someone ever taken money from one of your classmates? Don't let it happen to you. If you have to go home late, you should let your parents know.\n\nUse the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for your studies. But some things on the Internet aren't good for kids, do try to look at \n\n pages that aren't good for you. You can use the Web for fun or homework. Can't you find any good Web sites for children?

Do you speak e-mail English? Maybe you don't. E-mail English is a new kind of English that many people use to save time. A lot of e-mail English words come from a computer program called QQ, which means I seek(\u5bfb\u627e)you. Ian Lancashire, a Canadian teacher, likes QQ, \u201cPeople can use QQ to talk with each other using computer. But, you have to be able to type quickly or the other person will be bored. So e-mail English can give some help.\u201d\n\n A message in e-mail English mostly uses two kinds of new words. The first kind is made up of the first letters of the words. These are called acronyms. The second kind is homophones\uff0cletter combination(\u5408\u5e76), symbols that sound like other words.\n\nAcronyms in an e-mail save space and time. It takes a long time to write \n\n. BTW is much faster. Other acronyms are F2F which stands for \n\n, CSL for \n\n and DBEYR for \n\n Some of the acronyms look like strange words, such as SWAK. But this one means \n\n Homophones often use letters and numbers that sound like words or parts of words. For example, 8 sound like\u2014\n\n in \n\nt, to save time, people write gr8. Another example is CU for \n\n or sometimes CU l8r (\n\n The number 2 is used for \n\n or \n\nand the number 4 is used instead of \n\n.\n\n Another part of e-mail is emotive symbols(\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7) which make faces when you look at them sideways. The most common emotive, is the happy face :). A comma (\u9017\u53f7) is often used to help add other parts of the face and show different expressions.\n\n E-mail English is fun. An e-mail message with lots of e-mail English starts to look like secret code(\u5bc6\u7801). Your best friend will probably understand it, but your parents and teachers may not. In fact, many teachers don't like e-mail English. It's not just because they can't \n\n what it means. It's because students start to use e-mail English in their everyday writing. E-mail English is great for writing quickly.

That's to say, girls are as clever as boys. And boys have more interests than girls, so they may not do well in their study.\n\nSecondly, girls are more careful and more sensible than boys.

When you point downwards and swing your arm from side to side, it means \"no\". If you want the pilot to know that it's safe to land, push your hands out in front of you and bend (\u5f2f\u66f2) your knees. If you want to say that it's not safe to land, put your arms in the air and move them to one side.\n\nSmoke signals\n\nThe smoke from a fire can be seen from far away, so it's a good way to draw attention. If the weather is dry, it isn't hard to start a fire. Remember, however, that fires can be very dangerous if they get out of control. Never light a tire unless you're sure that it can't spread. If the ground is dark, light smoke can be seen more easily. Green grass and leaves produce light smoke.\n\nGround-to-air signals\n\nIt's a good idea lo build some signals, too. Use large pieces of wood to make the symbols (\u6807\u8bb0). If you can't find any wood, use earth.

There are all kinds of strange, unclear rules about which of the rabbit's feet is the luckiest. It is said that this good luck tradition is the oldest one of all. However, as the funny saying goes, \"Depend on the rabbit's foot if you will, but remember it didn't work for the rabbit!\"\n\n People in Britain love trees.

Be careful with your things whenever you go to crowded places, like a train station.\n\n7. Always leave room in your bag for souvenirs(\u7eaa\u5ff5\u54c1).\n\n8. Tour buses often stop at expensive shops along the way. Save your money by buying souvenirs at local shops.\n\n9.

Summer holiday is the longest one, and runs from mid-June until early September. Summer camp is one of kids' favorite places to go to, where they can make new friends and try some new activities. Winter holiday starts from mid-December and ends in early January. Most kids and their parents go to spend time together over the Christmas period. Spring break comes in mid- March and (63) \n\n is usually a 10-day holiday.\n\nSchools in Japan start in April, as most people think that spring is the perfect time for new things.

So I always study hard when I am at school, but on my day off I often do something else to relax myself.\n\n I had a very relaxing day off. In the morning, I got up at seven o'clock. Then I went to run with my father. I think we need to exercise every day. After all, it's important to keep healthy. After running, I took a shower and had breakfast. At nine o'clock, I went to the aquarium with my friends. We saw some sharks and seals there. Sharks are very scary but the seals are cute. We also saw a dolphin show. I think dolphins are very clever animals. In the giftshop, we bought many gifts. We had great fun there.\n\n In the afternoon, my parents took me to see my grandparents. They live in the beautiful countryside. They were very happy to see me. I talked with my grandparents for long and he told me many interesting things about him.

Chinese women belong to the \"winter season\" if they have pale skin. Kylie says that Chinese women who have dark eyes and dark hair will look best in deep, rich colours.

That's how millions of people start their day at Laughter(\u7b11\u58f0) Clubs around the world and many doctors now think that having a good laugh might be one of the best ways to stay healthy.\n\nThe first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995 by Dr. Madan Kataria.\u201cYoung children laugh about 300 times a day. Adults laugh between 7 and 15 times a day,\u201d says Dr. Kataria. \u201cEveryone is naturally good at laughing \u2014 it's the common language. We want people to feel happy with their lives.\u201d There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1,300 in the world.\n\nMany doctors are also interested in the effects(\u6548\u679c) of laughter on our health. According to a 5-year study at the UCLA School of Medicine in California, with laughing there is less stress in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%.\n\nSo what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to my nearest club in South London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class, to be honest, I wasn't interested in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking silly. Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \u201cho ho ho, ha ha ha\u201d while looking at each other. However, our bodies can't tell the difference between real laughter and unreal laughter, so they still produce the same healthy effects.\n\nSurprisingly, it works! After ten minutes everybody in the room was laughing for real and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was surprised by how relaxed and comfortable I felt. So if you're under stress, then start laughing. You might be very pleased with the results.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The first Laughter Club was started in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:How many Laughter Clubs are there in the world today?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:How did the writer feel at the beginning of the class?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:When did the people in the club begin to laugh for real?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The article mainly tells us \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n\u5c0f\u98985:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/1mq1c303294367.html"},

It seems as if your hands have aged 30 years in a second. But is this an accident? Or is it something that nature has built into our bodies?\n\nIf your finger's wrinkling up had no use at all, \u201c it wouldn't need to.\u201d Professor Tom Smulders from Newcastle University, UK, told BBC News. By studying wet fingers closely, Smulders and his partners found that the wrinkles looked a bit like the patterns on the car tire or on the bottom of the running shoes. So they made a guess that wrinkles on fingers might be able to help the hand hold things more tightly.\n\nTo test\n\n, researchers asked 20 people to pick up marbles from water with their hands. But before they started, some of the people had to keep their hands in water for half an hour.\n\nThe researchers found that the people with wrinkled fingers completed the task the task faster than those with dry hands. But when they were asked to move dry marbles, all the people performed equally well, no matter they had the wrinkled fingers or not.\n\nOur ancestors might not have played with marbles, but wrinkled fingers could have made it easier for them to climb around in the wet forests and catch fish from rivers, researchers say.\n\nSimilarly, our toes also get wrinkled in water. This may have developed from our ancestor's need to run on wet ground.\n\nBut the question is, if wrinkled fingers are so helpful, why don't our hands just stay that way all the time? Researchers explained that wrinkling has its disadvantage: wet fingertips are far less sensitive than smooth ones, reducing our sense of touch.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What does the underlined world \u201cthis \u201d in the third paragraph refer to?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The test shows that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What might be the disadvantage of wrinkled fingers?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/13wec303294406.html"},

Karachi has over 5 million people and Lahore has over 3 million people. Islamabad was built to be Pakistan's capital.

The trains are still the most common transport of long-distance travel for Pakistanis. Pakistan also has an airline that operates domestic and international flights.\n\nIt is difficult to identify (\u8bc6\u522b) Pakistani food because the country shares food traditions with its neighbour, India. The main difference between Pakistani and Indian food is that Pakistani food is less spicy (\u8f9b\u8fa3). Pakistani dishes are often made with yoghurt(\u9178\u5976), which reduces the effect of the hot spices used in cooking.\n\nWheat is the main food for most of the people. It is eaten in the form of bread named chapattis or roti, together with vegetables in season. Sweet tea, milk, or lassi, a drink made from yoghurt, makes the meal perfect.

Most important are your weight and height. Smokejumpers in the U.S. for example ,must be 54 to 91 kilograms, so they don't get hurt when they land, or get blown by strong winds.\n\nSmokejumpers must be able to live in the wilderness. in Russia ,many smokejumpers know how to find food in the forest and even make simple furniture from trees.\n\nThey work is dangerous, the hours are long. But for these firefighters, smokejumpers isn't just a job. They love being able to jump out of planes, fight fires, and live in the forest.

She's bringing her kids with her, too.\n\nAfter the party we're going to have another one on Saturday! Well, not really a party. We're inviting the family and close friends (that includes you) for a meal at the house. If the weather is nice, we'd like to have a barbecue in the garden. Julie's going to make a special cake for Suzie.\n\nAnyway, we hope to make it a really special weekend for Suzie. On Sunday we're all going for a walk in the country. You know how she loves walking and we're all going to need a bit of exercise after all that lovely food. We're hoping to go up to the lake. Marie said she wanted her kids to feed the ducks just like Suzie and she did when they were very young. I'm sure Suzie will love that too.\n\nIt would be great if you could come over for the weekend.

It is a good chance for a short family trip around the city. \n\n\u9605\u8bfb\u77ed\u6587\uff0c\u6309\u8981\u6c42\u5b8c\u6210\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\n\n\u4efb\u52a1\u4e00\u3000\u5c06\u5c0f\u98984:\u5904\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u82f1\u6587\u3002\n\n\u4efb\u52a1\u4e8c\u3000\u5c06\u5c0f\u98985:\u5904\u659c\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u4e2d\u6587\u3002\n\n\u4efb\u52a1\u4e09\u3000\u5199\u51fa\u5c0f\u98986:\u5904\u201cit\u201d\u6307\u4ee3\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\n\n\u4efb\u52a1\u56db\u3000\u5c0f\u98987:What do Japanese kids usually do in their spring break?\n\n\u4efb\u52a1\u4e94\u3000\u5c0f\u98988:\u4e3a\u8be5\u6587\u6bb5\u62df\u5199\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u9898\u3002\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:It may not be a dream any more!\n(It\u2019s not a dream any more!)\n(It\u2019s no more a dream!)\n\u5c0f\u98982:\u6211\u5c31\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u54c1\u5473\u56db\u5b63\u7f8e\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u53ea\u662f\u57cb\u5934\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\n\u5c0f\u98983:Spring break\n\u5c0f\u98984:They often take a short family trip around the city.\n\u5c0f\u98985:Seasonal holidays and holiday activities \n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/kxfrc303293785.html"},

Last month, I had a chance at last to go on such a holiday with some of my schoolmates and we went to London, a place where I had wanted to go since years ago.\n\n As we were still young, we had a group leader who planned things for us and looked after us. After we got to London, we went to stay with different families. I was lucky that my host family(\u5bc4\u5bbf\u5bb6\u5ead) was a white couple who had a daughter about my age. They treated me as a daughter of their family during my stay there. They were interested in me and I learnt a lot of things from them, too.\n\n The holiday was filled with activities every day. After breakfast, a local teacher would come to take us in his car. Then we would have classes or go on a sight-seeing trip to different places of interest like the Big Ben, the London Bridge, and the Buckingham Palace. We would go back to our own homes after the activities.\n\nThe holiday was a valuable experience for me. I enjoyed every minute of it. Yet, time really flew fast.

One bubble is a kitchen with round shelves, another bubble is the garden room, and the third bubble is a music room.

All\n\nyour experiment you take down notes, which are\n\n\u00a0\u00a0experiment date(\u8d44\u6599). You are constantly making observations during this time. You may make discoveries that cause you to improve your experiment as you go.\n\n, you conclude your experiment and begin to look over your notes to decide what it all means. Based on what you have learned, you make a final statement about \n\nyour hypothesis was correct or not. You have to have reasons and evidence to support what you are saying.\n\nUsing the scientific method can be difficult, but rewarding. Because all the steps are organized in a process, the\n\nare more valid(\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684). When you provide observations as evidence to support what you are saying, your ideas are more likely to be accepted.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n\u5c0f\u98986:D\n\u5c0f\u98987:C\n\u5c0f\u98988:C\n\u5c0f\u98989:A\n\u5c0f\u989810:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/sjsmc303293550.html"},

Scientists say the body produces tears because they need them. One kind of tears is for the eye, the other is for the heart. They both work as cleaners. If something else like dust(\u7070\u5c18) gets into your eye, tears also come into the eye to clean it out. If you are hurt by something, your strong feelings produce some poisonous chemicals(\u6bd2\u7d20) in your body, and at the same time, tears come out with them. If these poisonous chemicals are not cleaned out of your body as soon as possible, they will do harm to the heart sooner or later.\n\nIn the United States men have heart problems more often than women do. Doctors say heart problems have something to do with the pressures(\u538b\u529b) of living and working now. Perhaps men suffer more from these illnesses because they do not cry enough. They need to cry more.\n\nIn fact, you can find many ways of reducing the pressures to keep fit. Crying is a natural and physical one.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:How many kinds of tears does the body usually produce?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What do tears do when dust gets into your eye?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Will the poisonous chemicals in the body do harm to the heart?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Why do men suffer more from heart problems than women?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:What will you do to reduce the pressures of living and working to keep fit?

But today many countries have their own kind of\u00a0 hip hop music . This kind of music comes from reggae, disco and funk music . Rapping means speaking to the\u00a0 rhythm of the music, and it is an important part of the music . People rap to express how they feel about their lives and problems .\n\n Rapping in class.\n\n Would you like to rap in class? Well actually, hip pop music is played in more than 10,000 schools in the USA .Why ? There is a new school program called \u201c Flocabulary \u201din which teachers use texts and hip hop CDs to help teach different school subjects . The words of the songs are just what students are studying . This makes learning easy and fun . Students and teachers are excited about the \n\n results it has had on exam marks . One teacher said, \u201c I've used hip hop songs in class, and I have never seen my students so crazy about history ! You can't imagine how well they imagine how well they remember what I teach ! We even try to write our own songs . \u201d\n\nWhose idea was Flocabulary?\n\nBlake Harrison, a high school student, was the first person to come up with the idea of Flocabulary . The word \u201c Flocabulary \u201d comes from the word \u201c flow \u201d and \u201c vocabulary \u201d . \u201c Flow \u201d is a rap word for \u201c style \u201d,or the way a rapper says the words of a song . \u201c Vocabulary \u201d means the words you have to learn in a language . How did he get the idea ? Well, he realized he could remember the words of a hip hop song very easily . So,why not make lessons into songs ? Today together with Alex Rappaport, a song writer, Blake produces hip hop songs for maths, science and literature (\u6587\u5b66\uff09.

He decides to change his name to \u201cPi\u201d.\n\nBut Pi's name problems are nothing compared to what is waiting for him.\n\nPi's father owns a zoo. He decides to move to Canada. The family, together with all the zoo animals, set sail across the Pacific. One day, a huge storm hits the ship. The next morning, Pi finds his family has sunk with the ship. He is the only person still alive.\n\nHe finds himself on a lifeboat with several animals, one of which is a tiger called Richard Parker. Soon, all the animals are killed and Pi is left alone with the tiger.\n\nAs the tiger becomes hungrier, Pi starts to fish to feed him. Otherwise, he himself will become the food.\n\nThe boy and the tiger develop an amazing relationship on the sea. Although he feels hopeless, Pi never gives up. After 227 days, the lifeboat finally lands on a beach in Mexico, but Richard Parker runs away into the forest. \n\nThe ship company finds Pi and asks what happened. Pi tells them about Richard Parker but the company doesn't believe him. Pi then tells another story in which there is no tiger, but some other shocking details(\u7ec6\u8282). \n\nIs there really another story? If so, which one is the truth?

For example, if you were late because your car broke down, maybe you need to have your car checked more regularly. Or, you might start to carry the useful phone numbers with you, so you could call for help when in need. For another example, if your colleague(\u540c\u4e8b) causes you problems on the job for lack of responsibility or ability, find ways of dealing with his irresponsibility or inability rather than simply blame the person. Ask to work with a different person, or don't depend on the person.

It was set up by the UNESCO(\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u6559\u79d1\u6587\u7ec4\u7ec7) in 1995 to encourage people, especially teenagers, to discover the pleasure of reading. It is also the day to honor great writer, for example, William Shakespeare, born or dead on that day.\n\n Many countries celebrate World Book Day. Take UK as an example. On that day, millions of school children can buy books of special price, a much lower price than usual, in any bookstore. It has been done every year since 1998. World Book Day is also celebrated in China. Premier Wen Jiabao does lots of reading every day. Wen has called on people to do more reading. He suggested that young people should spend more time reading. \u201cBook cannot change the world, but people can change the world by changing themselves through reading,\u201d he said.\n\n Why do people like reading? One big advantage is that reading helps us become more knowledgeable and more intelligent. Also, reading helps us to follow the latest developments of science and technology. Besides, reading gives us information about other cultures and places of the world. When we read, we may find many things that are unfamiliar to us. We would have to use our brain to think about them or do more reading to find out the answers. The more we read, the more we know. What's more, reading is also one of the most important ways to learn a foreign language like English. \n\n \u201cReading makes a full man\u201d. Books, magazines, newspapers and other kinds of materials can help us to know more about the outside world and perfect us.

As I walked with my family along the river I saw a statue. It was a young man who looked just like me. He was wearing a cap and smiling. Around his neck was a leather strap (\u76ae\u5e26) and in his hands was a saxophone. He was lifting the saxophone to his lips and he was just about to play. I stayed there for a long time by the statue dreaming of playing a saxophone on TV.\n\nTwo weeks later it was my birthday. Imagine my joy when I opened my present from my parents and found that it was a saxophone! I put it to my lips to play, but it wouldn't make a sound. Then Dad told me to read the instruction book to find out what to do. After about 15 minutes the saxophone was ready to play. I raised it slowly to my lips as my family watched. But still there was no sound. I blew and blew but I couldn't get the saxophone to play. I was almost crying when suddenly the saxophone made the most beautiful sound\u2014loud and clear like I imagined the music of the man by the river in Kobe. I blew again, I moved my fingers on the saxophone and I made more sounds. I was happy because I was playing very interesting sounds. But I wasn't playing music yet.\n\nThen came the lessons. Night after night, week after week my teacher made me practice. Slowly I started to improve and at last there came the magic day when I started to play music.

In a restaurant in Xinjiang, the owner gives the guests who have eaten up all that they ordered a sticker. People can enjoy a free meal when they have 10 stickers. More than 750 restaurants in Beijing have begun to offer smaller dishes and encourage their guests to take leftovers(\u5269\u996d\u5269\u83dc) home.\n\nWasting food is a serious problem around the world, not only in China. It's said that 2 billion tons(\u5428) of food ends up as waste every year in our country. This is as much as half of all the food in the world. The UN Environment Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization held a\u201cThink, Eat, Save\u201d program on January 24 to help reduce food waste. \n\nTo reduce food waste is a big task, and it needs time. It's important that everyone does their bit, just like Qi.

You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you!\n\n Parapsychologists (\u7075\u5b66\u5bb6) say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a\u201csixth sense\u201dreally exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist (\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6) at the University of Kentucky, did two experiments.\n\n In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared(\u76ef\u7740\uff09at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects\uff08\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\uff09were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost\u00a0all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them.\n\n For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. \n\n Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at.

About 750,000 people pass through Grand Central every day. Some just come to look at it, others to visit the stores. But most are there to catch the trains that enter and leave from the station. It is the largest train station in the world. There are 67 train tracks, all of them underground.\n\nThe main part of the building has large, arched windows, a jeweled four-sided clock and ticket windows. Grand Central has been seen in many movies through the years. Dan Brucker is with the New York Transit Authority, which operates the station. Dan Brucker has worked for the transit authority at Grand Central for 30 years.

I find that I'm not good at writing compositions. It's hard for me to prepare the form of a composition and organize sentences. \u2460Could you tell me how to deal with this problem? I would really appreciate if you offer me some good methods.\n\n Best wishes,\n\nCindy\n\nHi Cindy,\n\nA composition is really a story and any story is told to an audience. There is a form for this and it is in three parts. First, tell them(the audience) what you are going to tell them. Then tell them, and finally tell them what you told them. Parts one and three are short and most of the information is in part two. It works like this.\n\nLet's say you are asked to write a 200-word composition about your visit to the Great Wall. You would begin with an opening sentence or two saying something like \u201cThe Great Wall of China is a national \u2461\n\n that is famous around the world. I visited it last summer and I want to tell you about it.\u201d That uses about 25 words to tell them what you are going to tell them.\n\nThe second part would be about 150 words and would contain information about the Great Wall such as how long it is, when it was built, who built it and why, the fact that it is one of the seven wonders of the world and you would talk about how you felt and what you thought when you visited this national treasure. This is telling them.\n\nFinally, you would use about another 25 words to say something like \u201cThat was my first visit to the Great Wall and it was a very emotional experience to actually touch something so old and famous.\n\n\u2462\n\nI plan to go back whenever I can.\u201d Here, you are telling them what you told them in the story and wrapping it all up into a neat package. This formula(\u60ef\u4f8b)works for both compositions and speeches and I think you will find it helps to organize your thoughts. I hope it's helpful.\n\nBest wishes,\n\n Brad Franklin\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:\u5c06\u6587\u4e2d\u2460\u5904\u7684\u753b\u7ebf\u90e8\u5206\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u6c49\u8bed\uff1a\n\n.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:(A) \u8bd5\u5199\u51fa\u6587\u4e2d\u2461\u5904\u753b\u7ebf\u90e8\u5206landmark\u7684\u6c49\u8bed\u610f\u601d\uff1a\n\n.\n\n(B)\u4e0b\u9762\u6709\u56db\u4e2a\u5728\u6587\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5355\u8bcd\uff0c\u8bf7\u627e\u51fa\u753b\u7ebf\u90e8\u5206\u53d1\u97f3\u54ea\u4e2a\u4e0e\u4f17\u4e0d\u540c? \n\n.\n\nA. w\n\nk\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B. w\n\nd\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C. inf\n\nmation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 D. w\n\nld\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:\u5c06\u6587\u4e2d\u2462\u5904\u7684\u6c49\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u82f1\u8bed\uff1a \n\n.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:\u4ece\u6587\u4e2d\u627e\u51fa\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8bcd\u7ec4\u586b\u7a7a\uff1aHow I wish to get a letter from you soon!\n\nHow I wish to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u00a0 \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ you soon!\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:\u7528\u82f1\u8bed\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff1aWhat's the main idea of the passage? \n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:\u4f60\u80fd\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u600e\u6837\u5904\u7406/\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5417\uff1f\n\u5c0f\u98982:(A) \u5730\u6807\uff1b\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B) C\n\u5c0f\u98983:Every Chinese should visit the Great Wall at least once.\n\u5c0f\u98984:hear\u00a0 from\n\u5c0f\u98985:How to write a composition/an article?/ The way of writing a composition./ How to prepare the form of a composition and organize sentences.\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/2g5lc303292614.html"},

But it seems that four out of five young people now get on with their parents, which is the opposite of the popularly held image of unhappy teenagers locked in their room after endless family quarrels. \n\nAn important new study into teenage attitudes (\u6001\u5ea6) surprisingly shows that their family life is happier than it has ever been in the past. \u201cWe were surprised by just how positive (\u79ef\u6781\u7684) today's young people seem to be about their families,\u201d said one member of the research team. \u201cThey're expected to be rebellious\uff08\u53db\u9006\u7684\uff09and selfish but actually they have other things on their minds; they want a car and material goods, and they worry about whether school is serving them well. There's discussion between parents and children, and children expect to take part in the family decision-making process. They don't want to rock the boat.\u201d \n\nSo it seems that these parents are much more likely than parents of 30 years ago to treat their children as friends. \u201cMy parents are happy to discuss things with me and willing to listen to me,\u201d says 17-year-old Daniel LaSalle. \u201cI always tell them when I'm going out clubbing. When they know what I'm doing, they're fine with it.\u201d Susan Cromer, who is now 21, agrees. \u201cLooking back on the last 10 years, there was a lot of what you could call talk or discussion. For example, when I'd done all my homework, I could go out on a Saturday night. But I think my grandparents were a lot stricter with my parents than that.\u201d\n\nMaybe this positive view of family life should not be unexpected. It is possible that the idea of teenage rebellion\uff08\u53db\u9006\uff09is not based on real facts. A researcher explains, \u201cTeenagers were thought to be different from others in a part of time in our social history. But to our surprise, they say they are getting on well with their parents.

My six children were ten, nine, eight, six, three and 18 months, and I was overwhelmed(\u4e0d\u77e5\u6240\u63aa\u7684) with the responsibilities of earning a living, caring for the children and simply \n\n.\n\nI was lucky to find a wonderful housekeeper to care for the children during the week, but from Friday nights to Monday mornings, the children and I were alone, and frankly(\u5766\u8bda\u5730) I was uneasy. Every unusual noise or any late-night phone call filled me with fear. I felt really alone. \n\nOne Friday evening I came home from work to find a big beautiful German shepherd(\u7267\u7f8a\u72ac) on our doorstep. It was obvious he wanted to make the house his home. The children took an instant liking to \u201cGerman\u201d and asked me to let him in. I agreed to let him sleep in the basement(\u5730\u4e0b\u5ba4) until the next day. That night I slept peacefully for the first time in many weeks. \n\nThe following morning we made phone calls and checked lost-and-found ads for German's owner, but with no results. Saturday night he was still with us.\u00a0\n\n On Sunday I had planned to take the children on a picnic. Since I thought it best to leave German behind in case(\u4ee5\u514d) his owner came by, we drove off without him. When we stopped to get gas at a local station, we were amazed to see German racing to the gas station after us. He stayed again Sunday night.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Monday morning I let him out for a run while the children got ready for school. He didn't come back. We thought we'd never see him again. On Friday evening, German was back again. We took him in, and again he stayed until Monday morning, when our housekeeper arrived. It went like this for almost 10 months. We looked forward to his coming. Each Monday morning he left home. \n\n Each week, between German's visits, I grew a little braver, but every weekend I enjoyed being with him . Then one Monday morning we patted his head and let him out for what turned out to be the last time. He never came back. We never saw or heard from German again. I think of him often. He came when I needed him the most and stayed until I was strong enough to go on alone. I believe German was sent because he was needed, and because no matter how abandoned(\u88ab\u653e\u5f03\u7684) and alone we feel, somehow, somewhere, someone knows and cares.

It is the story of someone who tried to look as rich as his neighbours.\n\nThe expression was first used in 1913 by a young American called Arthur Momand. He told this story about himself. He began earning \\\\$ 125 a week at the age of 23. That was a lot of money in those days. He got married and moved with his wife to a very wealthy neighbourhood outside New York City. When he saw that rich people rode horses, Momand went horseback riding every day. When he saw that rich people had servants, Momand and his wife also hired a servant and gave big parties for their new neighbours.\n\nIt was like a race, but one could never finish his race because one was always trying to keep up. The race ended for Momand and his wife when they could no longer pay for their new way of life. They moved back to an apartment in New York City.\n\nMomand looked around him and noticed that many people do things just to keep up with rich lifestyle of their neighbours. He saw the funny side of it and started to write a series of short stories. He called it \u201cKeeping up with the Joneses\u201d because \u201cJones\u201d is a very common name in the United States. \u201cKeeping up with the Joneses\u201d came to mean keeping up with rich lifestyle of the people around you. Momand's series appeared in different newspapers across the country for over 28 years.\n\nPeople never seem to get tired of keeping up with the Joneses.

Of course, you save time by reading fast, but this is not the main reason for fast reading. The main reason is that you understand better what you are reading when you read fast.\n\n As your eyes move along the line of point, they make fixations (\u56fa\u5b9a) or pauses (\u6682\u505c). It is important that you see several words at a fixation. It is also important that your eyes leave a group. The numbers of letters or words that you see at a fixation are called your eye span (\u89c6\u8de8). Pay more attention to improving your rate of reading. With practice you can learn to read faster than you usually read.\n\n The way in which you read always depends on (\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e) what you are reading and for what purpose. You should know the different ways of reading so that you can apply whatever method is necessary. Here are four ways of reading:\n\n (1) Skimming is an important kind of reading.

They might shake hands (\u63e1\u624b), kiss or hug (\u62e5\u62b1). But do you ever wonder how dogs say hello?\n\nIf you are a dog lover, you already know the answer to this question. When you arrive home, your dog jumps up into your lap (\u5927\u817f\u524d\u90e8). It wags (\u6447\u6446) its tail, and sometimes gives you wet kisses.\n\nLike humans, dogs have five senses (\u611f\u89c9): smell, touch, sight, hearing and taste. Humans use sight as the main sense for recognizing (\u8ba4\u51fa) one another. But dogs have poor eyesight. They use smell to recognize others. A dog's sense of smell is much better than a human's. It is through its sense of smell that tells the differences between different people.\n\nDogs use smell to recognize other dogs, too. They tell the differences by the smell of pee (\u5c0f\u4fbf) and pooh (\u5927\u4fbf). When two dogs meet, they smell each other's noses. Then they go side to side, and smell each other's butts (\u5c41\u80a1). By smelling its friend's behind, a dog knows who it is with.\n\nThat is also why dogs smell everything they can on the road. By smelling grass, trees and signposts (\u8def\u6807), dogs know which other neighborhood dogs have been around.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:People have different ways of greeting each other except \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:How does a dog greet you?\n\nA.

These things may help decide what the baby will be like.\n\nBut one's personality doesn't stop here. Family life, school learning and life experiences can also make you the person you are. This doesn't mean it's impossible to change your personality. You can always try to make yourself better. Don't get too worried about your shortcomings (\u7f3a\u70b9). Just accept them. This is a good way to start making changes.\n\nIf you don't know how to make friends, find out why. Is it because you're too shy? Tell yourself to smile at people.

Here's our advice to you ---and to all kids who feel lonely sometimes.\u00a0\n\nIt's hard when a best friend isn't around --- maybe because he or she moved to a different school or a different class. You may feel left out at break or lunchtime. You want to have new friends, but how do you make them? Maybe it seems everybody else already has his or her friends. But remember, there's always room for more friends.\n\nStart by looking around your classroom --- think about which kids you'd like to play with at break. Look for chances to say hi to them, smile, and be friendly. Offer to share something or express your appreciation (\u6b23\u8d4f) to them. Invite someone to play with you or say, \u201cDo you want to sit here?\u201d in the lunchroom. When you're at break, walk over to kids you want to play with, act friendly, and say \u201cHi, can I play, too?\u201d or just join in.\u00a0\n\nIf you have trouble doing this or if you're feeling shy, ask your teacher to help you make new friends. Teachers are usually pretty good at matching up friends. The best way to make friends is to be a friend.

Among them, Pride and Prejudice written in 1779 was the most popular. Victor Hugo, born in 1802 in France, was one of the best writers in the19th century. The talent in writing and hard work brought great success to Hugo at an early age. His most popular novel, the Hunchback of Notre-\n\nDame, was written in 1831. The book was so successful that it was quickly translated into many other languages across Europe. Ernest Hemingway, an outstanding American writer and reporter, was born in 1899. His life experience had a great influence on his writing style. Hemingway lived in France and Italy between the 1920s and 1950s.

According to the UN World Food Program, there were 925 million hungry people around the world in 2010, especially in developing countries. Six million children die of hunger every year.\n\nChinese people are well known for being generous(\u6177\u6168\u7684). Many even feel that they lose face if their guests have eaten all the food on the table.\n\nLuckily, a number of people have realized the importance of saving food. Last November, Li Hong, a waitress in a restaurant in Nanjing, got fired(\u5f00\u9664) because she took some leftover(\u5269\u4f59\u7684) food home for her son. Many people stood by her side and agreed that it was not right to waste food.\n\nWhat should we do in our daily lives to waste less food? Here are some tips:\n\n1. Do not order(\u70b9\u83dc) too much in a restaurant. Only order what you want to eat. If you cannot eat all the food you ordered, take the rest of it home.\n\n2. Don't be too picky(\u6311\u5254\u7684) about food. Some food may not taste great, but your body needs it.\n\n3. Keep an eye on what food you have at home.

You may be able to save 100% of your money. Does that mean you should? Not at all. The best way to develop good saving habits is to make saving a regular part of your life, along with spending.\n\nHere is the rule you should remember: save before spending. Whenever some money gets into your hands, from a job or your pocket money or whatever, take your savings out immediately, before spending any of the money. The beauty of this system is that if you take away your savings, you are free to spend the rest.\n\nHere are some more suggestions on how to successfully get into the saving habit from teens. Let's see!\n\nTony,13: I put my money in a bank instead of my wallet, so the money is not there. And I have to take an extra step to get it.\n\nBill,14: When considering a major purchase(\u8d2d\u4e70), wait a week or so, at least. This will help you make sure if you still want it, and the price might go down.\n\nDick, 13: Carry very little money always. You can't spend money if you don't have it. A cake would be nice, but without a dollar, you can't get it. Little things like that really add up quickly.\n\nSteve,16: I used to be weak when it came to money. I bought something whenever I went into a store. I'm glad I'm not that person now. I taught myself discipline by keeping a \\\\$20 bill in my pocket while waking around the mall all day and not buying anything. Now I have no strong wish to buy things when I go into a store.

If he spends most of his time playing about in the way he used to as a child, he will go hungry.

On the other hand, a growing number of people hope to use their cars to show off (\u70ab\u8000).

There is an old saying \u201cFriends are God's way of taking care of us.\u201d But how do you find real friendship and keep it?\n\n The American writer Sally Seamans tells young students some smart ways to find friends. Sally says finding friendship is just like planting a tree. You plant the seed and take care of it to make it grow.\n\n First, you should choose a friend. What makes a good friend? It is not because a person has money or good looks. A good friend should be kind and patient. For example, if you have a bad day, a good friend should listen to your complaints and do his or her best to help. To make a friend, you can not be too shy. You should make each other happy and share your lives. But things cannot always be happy. Even the best have fights. What should you do when you have a fight with your friend? You have to talk to him or her. When there is no one around, have an honest talk. If he or she doesn't want to talk, you could write a letter.\n\n There are three steps to being friends again:\n\n Tell him or her how you are feeling ; say what your friend has done wrong, and explain why you did this or that. Remember that friendship is the most important thing in your life.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Sally wants to tell students the ways to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What makes good friends?

Research shows that children who have no friends can suffer from difficulties later in life. Friendship provides children with more than just fun. In making friends, children learn how to get in touch with the others and solve problems. Having friends even does good to children's study for they can help each other during the class. \n\nIf the parents care about their children whether they made many friends\uff0cwhat matters is that the child is comfortable and happy with his friends. Parents need to understand the steps children take in building friendships. First of all, be a friend to your child. Good friendships start at home. Children begin to develop the necessary ability to go out and meet others through getting with their parents. Greet the child warmly and let him know you are glad to see him. Children learn a lot from how their parents stay with them and other people. \n\nTeach children how to solve conflicts(\u4e89\u7aef). Being able to work out conflicts is an important skill in getting along with others. If parents know the children have a conflict, let them work it out on their own. Only step in if it is really necessary, for example, an argument is getting physical. \n\nGive children chances to practice staying together. Have children play games that require team work and group problem solving skills. For example, races are fun and provide plenty of practice in teamwork. \u201cIn what ways didn't you work well together? What might you do differently next time?\u201d For these ideas, see books such as Games Book by Terry Orlick, Energizers by Carol Apacki, and Team-Building Activities for Every Group by Alanna Jones. \n\nEncourage children to show thanks to the others.

It is usually read on personal computers. Some mobile phones can also be used to read e\u2013books.\n\nEarlier e\u2013books were written for a certain group of readers and were about only a few subjects.

Besides, we can find the topic we want to know about on the Internet, and then we can quickly get many e\u2013books on similar topics. Second, e\u2013books save money. Some e\u2013books cost us little money, and there are millions of e\u2013books on the Internet that we can get for free. Third, more trees are saved because e\u2013books don't need to be printed on paper. Fourth, e\u2013books make reading more convenient. You can carry a whole library of hundreds of books with you in a small computer or any e\u2013book reader(\u9605\u8bfb\u5668), without worrying about their weight.\n\nBut e\u2013books have certain disadvantages.

The place should have a lot of air. This will keep some insects (\u866b\u5b50) away. High land with water on both sides of it is good. Then we put up our tent. We put everything into the tent, and we are ready for fun. We can swim in the lake, walk in the woods, climb a mountain, row a boat, or go fishing. In the evening we come back to the tent, we build a big fire because it can keep the insects away. We sit around the fire and talk. We may tell interesting stories or we may sing songs. At night we lie down on the grass. We can look up at the stars. It is a busy day, so we try to go to sleep early. Everything is dark. Everything is quiet.

Today, many people go to study and train for a future job in subjects like law (\u6cd5\u5f8b), medicine or education. But the university is not a modern invention. It has a history that is over a thousand years.\n\nThe world's oldest university, AL-Azhar, is in Cario, Egypt. It was first built as a mosque for religion (\u5b97\u6559\u5bfa\u9662) in A.D.972. A few years later, learners and teachers began meeting in the mosque. They read and talked about the subject of law. Around 988, leaders in the city of Cario decided to open up a school for higher learning and the University of AL-Azhar was founded.\n\nAt AL-Azhar, there were many university \u2018firsts'. Different subjects were set up. The earliest ones taught at AL-Azhar were in law and religion. In a course, students read and studied with the teacher, but there was also free discussion. Often, students and teachers talked about a topic (\u9898\u76ee), and there was no \u2018right' answer. Finally, famous teachers from around the world came to AL-Azhar to teach and do deep studies on the subjects they were interested in. At the university, people studied the past, but it was also a place for exchanging new ideas. \n\nOver a thousand years later, AL-Azhar is still an important university in the world. Its library keeps more than 250,000 of the world's oldest and most valuable (\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684) books. Today, many of the world's most important universities such as Oxford and Harvard still follow the traditions started at AL-Azhar.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:From the first paragraph\uff08\u6bb5\u843d\uff09 we know that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:AL-Azhar was first built for \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following are the earliest subjects taught in the University of AL-Azhar?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following is not true about the University of AL-Azhar?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/51pjc303284168.html"},

It can be exciting to get away from the same old bed in the same old room in the same old house. But fun as this is, for some kids being away from home can be scary and sad. It's called being homesick.\n\nHomesick means you are upset, sad, and maybe scared. But don't feel surprised. A lot of people get homesick, even grown-ups. When you're used to having certain people around you, it can be scary when they are gone. When you are dealing with other problems, you will feel homesick, too. Some kids may feel more homesick than usual if their parents get divorced ( \u79bb\u5a5a)or if someone they loved has recently died.\n\nHere are some ideas to help you feel less homesick.\n\nBring a little bit of home with you. If you're going away from home,bring your pillow or pictures of the people you will be apart from and look at them any time you want.\n\nKeep busy. The more fun things you do, the less time you'll have to feel homesick. So try to join in activities wherever you are.\n\nStay in touch. You can make a plan for when you will call your mum or dad. You can also send e-mails or text messages to keep in touch with family and friends. When you do get in touch with someone, make sure to talk about the fun things you're doing!\n\nTalk to someone where you are. Maybe you can tell a friend that you feel homesick.

What about when you go to a birthday party? Do you get really shy?\n\nShyness means feeling nervous or afraid when you're around other people. Experts have found that more than 80% of middle school students feel afraid to be the center of attention. Some kids are born shy. Some become shy later because of their life experiences(\u7ecf\u5386). \n\nIt's OK if it takes you a while\n\n when you go to a new place or meet new people. In fact, everybody gets a little shy sometimes. It's just a case of how much.\n\nMost people have red faces and talk in broken sentences when they get shy. But some become so shy that they won't go to a restaurant because they are too nervous to order and pay for their food. Some are afraid of meeting new people, so they seldom go outside. This kind of shyness can be bad for a person.\n\nIf shyness doesn't stop you from doing something you want to do, being shy isn't a very big problem. Some experts say shy people are cleverer because they think more and talk less. Shy people are also good at working with others because they think more for other people. Some great people in history were shy, too. \n\nYou see, being shy isn't all bad. But remember not to let good opportunities(\u673a\u4f1a) pass by just because of it! If you have to sing a song at a birthday party or practice your spoken English in front of others, just do it!

Restaurants, shops and parks are all great places to meet people. If you want to make local friends in a country, stay near the place the locals often visit.\n\nShow your photo album\uff08\u5f71\u96c6\uff09\n\nKeep a small photo album in your bag when you travel. Photos of family, friends and pets will help your new friends learn more about you and give you things to talk about. They will share their own stories with you, and it will help you learn more about your new friends.\n\nShare something special\n\nCan you help your new friends improve their Chinese? Can you cook a traditional Chinese meal? By sharing your skills, you can have a close friendship with your new friends that they won't soon forget.\n\nGive some gifts\n\nMany foreigners love Chinese goods but have to pay a lot when buying them in their homeland, so you'd better prepare some gifts such as silks, tea and works of art. They are always popular.\n\nExchange flats\n\nIf you and your new friends get along well, you can give them your information and plan to exchange flats for your next trip. Then you can visit their countries and stay in their houses while they stay in yours. In this way you will improve your friendship and live like a local abroad, but pay less for traveling.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The underlined word \n\n in the passage means \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:In which way can't a photo album help you?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:From the passage we can learn that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:This passage is mainly about how to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/8cmec203312533.html"},

If you cannot cry for help or run away, give the robber your money. Try to remember what the robber looks like and tell the police later.\n\n If you are in a traffic accident\n\n f a car hits you, you should remember the car number.

And there were no big hotels like the ones today. Now things have changed. Lots of nice big hotels have been built in recent years. However, the nice view in Hawaii hasn't changed much. In the morning , many tourists often take a walk along the water in. At night , they get together to hold parties, chatting and dancing. \n\nNow , you see Hawaii is really a good place to visit.

How will you escape\uff08\u9003\u8dd1\uff09? Do you know how to save yourself? Please read the following passage.\n\nEscaping a fire is a serious matter. Knowing what to do during a fire can save yourself. It is important to know the ways you can use and to show them to everyone in the family, such as stairways (\u697c\u68af) and fire escapes, but not lifts.\n\nFrom the lower floors of the buildings, escaping through windows is possible, learn the best way of leaving through windows with the least chance of serious injury (\u4f24\u5bb3).\n\nThe second floor window is usually not very high from the ground. An average person, hanging by the finger-tips (\u624b\u6307\u5c16) will have a drop of about six feet to the ground. It is about the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way than to stay in a burning building.\n\nWindows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed. Or smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked (\u6cc4\u9732) into the room.\n\nOn a second or third floor, the best windows for escape are those which open onto a roof (\u5c4b\u9876). From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely. Dropping onto cement (\u6c34\u6ce5) might end in injury. Bushes and grass can help to break a fall.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:It is important to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:It is possible to escape through the windows \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Keep your head low at the window so that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ if the building is on fire.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The best title for the passage is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/6de2c303304264.html"},

The 24-year-old young man lost his right leg because of a blood disease (\u8840\u6db2\u75c5). The doctor said that his 10 years of smoking had caused the disease.\n\n\u201cI first smoked a cigarette when I was in Junior 3. It made me feel like a man and I thought it looked cool. Now I know I was really wrong,\u201d said Zhang.\n\nAccording to the 2008 China Tobacco Control report (\u4e2d\u56fd\u70df\u8349\u63a7\u5236\u62a5\u544a), 130 million young people who are under 18 years old have tried smoking. Fifteen million of them are addicted (\u4e0a\u763e\u7684).\n\nThe report came out on May 31, World No-Smoking Day. It also found that nearly 68% of teenage smokers smoked their first cigarette before the age of 13. Those living in big cities started even earlier.\n\n\u201cSome tobacco companies try to make cigarettes cool and attractive. It's just to make money,\u201d said Yang Gonghuan, a doctor. In fact, smoking is one of the top killers in China. Each year 1 million people die from smoking-related (\u4e0e\u5438\u70df\u6709\u5173\u7684) diseases. Smoking causes illnesses like lung cancer and heart disease.\n\nDoctors say that the younger a person starts smoking, the worse it will be. If a person starts smoking as a teenager, he or she may live twenty-two years less than non-smokers.\u00a0\n\n\u56de\u7b54\u4e0b\u5217\u95ee\u9898\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What caused Zhang Li's disease?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:When did he first smoke a cigarette? \n\n\u5c0f\u98983:How many people die from smoking-related diseases each year in China?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:If someone smokes too much, what diseases can he develop?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Why do many teenagers smoke at first?\u00a0\uff08\u8bf7\u81ea\u62df\u4e00\u53e5\u8bdd\u4f5c\u7b54\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u7528\u6587\u4e2d\u53e5\u5b50\u6539\u5199\uff09\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:His 10 years of smoking (caused the disease). \n\u5c0f\u98982:He first smoked when He was in Junior 3.\n\u5c0f\u98983:One million.\n\u5c0f\u98984:He may develop diseases like hung cancer and heart disease.\n\u5c0f\u98985:Because they think smoking makes them feel like a man and look cool.\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/sl3fc303304268.html"},

This makes sure students won't fall over on the wet floors and keeps the schools clean.\n\nGum chewing is not allowed in many US school buildings, as it is difficult to clean up. And if students chew gum in class, they may not pay much attention to their studies.\n\nIn most foreign countries, school students are allowed to work part-time. But differently, Japanese school students are not allowed to work part-time or change the color of their hair.\n\n\u6839\u636e\u77ed\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7b54\u6848\u3002\uff08\u51715\u5c0f\u9898\uff0c\u6bcf\u5c0f\u98982\u5206\uff0c\u6ee1\u520610\u5206\uff09\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Which countries should students not be allowed to wear earrings \u00a0\u00a0 in ?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Are students allowed to change the color of their hair in Japan?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Why must students have a pair of indoor shoes at school every day  at some US schools?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What may happen if students chew gum in class?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:What shouldn't the students be allowed to do in Japan?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n\u5c0f\u98985:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/wjn4c303304469.html"},

And then, you should say, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\n This seems so simple, but it is surprising how many kids have never been told to do this. Actually, I notice adults all the time who cough and sneeze in public without placing a hand over the mouth. One important thing I point out to the kids is that after they sneeze or cough on their hands, they should wash their hands as soon as possible. If not, they will be passing those germs(\u7ec6\u83cc)along to everything and everyone they touch.\n\n If you come to a door and someone is following you, hold the door.

Teaching them small acts of kindness, such as letting someone else go through a door first as they hold it open, may seem unimportant, but it can go a long way toward helping students realize how to be polite and think others. Once they've been told, they're halfway there.\n\n When we have to go up moving stairs, we will stand to the right. That will give others who are in a hurry a choice of walking up the left-hand side of the moving stairs. When we are going to enter a lift, the underground, of a doorway, we will wait for others to exit before we enter.\n\n After college when I moved to London, I was surprised at how polite everyone was in the subways. I was even more touched when I traveled to Japan. In both places, people made effort to make way for others. On moving stairs, everyone stood to the right and walked to the left.

When water from the rain and melting(\u878d\u5316) snow runs through roads, it picks up some dangerous chemicals and other things along the way. Many of the rivers are short of protections, so they are easy to be polluted by factories or animals' waste.\n\nWorld Water Day has grown to become one of the important dates since 1993. In 2013, World Water Day shares the topic of Water Cooperation. If everyone tries their best to save and protect the clean water, our living conditions will be much better.\n\n\u6839\u636e\u77ed\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:From the first paragraph, we know that people couldn't live without \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Dirty water is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ to our heath.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Many of the rivers are easy to be polluted by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What's the topic of 2013 World Water Day?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Which of the following is TRUE(\u5bf9\u7684)?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n\u5c0f\u98985:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/3hgcc303303943.html"},

It is also known as kite boarding, and in some European countries as fly surfing. Kite surfing works through wind power (\u52a8\u529b) by using a large kite to pull a rider on the water at high speed.\n\nAt first, kite surfing was a difficult and dangerous sport. Now it is becoming easier and safer because of the safer kite design. For an able and strong person, kite surfing can be a very fun, extremely exciting sport, just like skating on the water with a feeling of flying. It has become more and more popular.\n\nCompared with other water sports, kite surfing is easier to learn. A beginner can understand how to operate the kite with 5--10 hours of training. And anybody aged from 13 to 65 can learn. It is not expensive to get the equipment for kite surfing, which costs \\\\$1,000 to 82,500. Training lessons range from \\\\$200 to \\\\$500 for two or three hours. With the development of its equipment progress, kite surfing is becoming even safer. After some training, you can enjoy its excitement and challenging feeling. \n\nWith the rising popularity of kite surfing, most major seaside cities have kite surfing clubs.

It's a huge task and if this \n\n\u00a0had received more support last year, fewer dogs would have been put down.\n\nTo support the efforts of HKDR, the Social Service Club held a fun festival last weekend. \u2018We hoped the festival would raise money and also raise people's awareness of the point of abandoned pets,' said Louise Wong, the club president.\n\nThe club organized stalls \n\n\u00a0second-hand clothes, delicious homemade cupcakes and even the fashions to keep pet dogs warm in the winter. Although there were fewer stalls than last year, \n\n\u00a0items were sold. Louise explained that this was because prices were not set too high this year.\n\nThe festival also \n\n\u00a0performances by the school choir and the hip hop group HK Boys. The crowd was extremely excited, and some members of the \n\n\u00a0said there was too much noise to hear the performers. Louise admitted that everyone would have been able to hear if there had been better sound equipment.\n\nThe most interesting part of the day was the dance challenge, with contestants(\u9009\u624b) showing off some amazing moves. This year there were more contestants than last year. According to Louise, that was because the prizes, including G. E.M. concert tickets, were better. \n\n, this year's fun festival was a big success. It raised far more money than last year: a record HK\\\\$12,000. And the festival also raised joy among the special guests \u2013 some of our four legged friends from HKDR! \n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n\u5c0f\u98985:C\n\u5c0f\u98986:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/jf1yc303303263.html"},

We went with our friends\uff0cEdward Smith and his wife Tina, to the Yorkshire Moors. It is a beautiful natural park. There are lots of places to walk on the tops of the hills\uff0cmiles of grassland with no people\uff0cjust sheep and birds.\n\n Edward had just come out of hospital and he could not walk as far as before. However, this meant that we walked in the mornings, and then stopped at a restaurant for lunch each day before returning to the place we lived in. Edward and I slept in front of the fire all afternoon, while the ladies went for another walk. Very pleasant! \n\nI took lots of photos from the place we lived in, across the valley (\u5c71\u8c37\uff09below us, of the morning sunrise, and the mist(\u8ff7\u96fe\uff09in the valley. Also, in England, the old steam-powered trains are very popular. I took many photos of the train.\n\nYesterday we had the first snow of this winter. It is very early. We usually have snow in January. It rained all day, then snowed in the evening .Today we have bright sunshine! Both Jenny and I are well. I don't know if I told you, in the last e-mail , that Jenny is now working in a hotel. Although she has to work hard, people there are nice, and she is enjoying the work.\n\nPlease write to us to tell us your news. \n\n Yours,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Victor\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What can they see on the tops of the hills?\u00a0\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why couldn't Edward walk very far?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What's the season now?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Where does Jenny work now?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Victor wrote to tell Sandy \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n\u5c0f\u98985:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/seczc203302710.html"},

People use them on trains and airplanes, in airports and hotels. These laptops connect people to their workplace. In the United States today, laptops also connect students to their classrooms.\n\nWestlake College in Virginia will start a laptop computer program that allows students to do schoolwork anywhere they want. Within five years, each of the 1500 students at the college will receive a laptop. The laptops are part of a \\\\$10 million computer program at Westlake, a 110-year-old college. The students with laptops will also have access to the Internet. In addition, they will be able to use e-mail to \u201cspeak\u201d with their teachers, their classmates, and their families. However, the most important part of the laptop program is that students will be able to use computers without going to computer labs. They can work with it at home, in a fast-food restaurant or under the trees-anywhere at all!\n\nBecause of the many changes in computer technology , laptop use in higher education, such as colleges and universities, is workable. As laptops become more powerful, they become more similar to desktop computers. In addition, the portable computers can connect students to not only the Internet, but also libraries and other resources. State higher-education officials are studying\ue009 how laptops can help students. State officials are also testing laptop programs at other universities, too.\n\nAt Westlake College, more than 60 percent of the staff use computers. The laptops will allow all teachers to use computers in their lessons. As one Westlake teacher said, \u201c Here we are in the middle of Virginia and we're giving students a window on the world.

Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly.\n\n People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book if they don't hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too.\n\n Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts (\u767d\u5185\u969c). Long ago these people often became blind.

It seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they cannot see it anymore, and they believe they were mistaken.

When I arrived, the students had already gone into class. I didn't go to the office, but went straight into class.

Even animals can be heroes. This passage tells about three amazing animals. Each one is a hero! \n\nThumper, the Dog\n\nThumper was a dog that lived with a family which had a three-year-old son named Benjamin. One day Benjamin wandered(\u95f2\u901b) into a large field. The grass in the field was taller than he was, so he could not find his way out. Hundreds of people began to search for Benjamin. When they found him, they saw Thumper stayed with Benjamin and kept him warm. So Benjamin had stayed safe.\n\nLulu, the Pig \n\n The Altsmans had a pet pig named Lulu. One summer the couple went camping and took Lulu with them. The husband went fishing one morning. The wife didn't feel well, so she and Lulu stayed in the camper. Suddenly Mrs. Altsman fell to the floor. Lulu pushed the camper door open and climbed out for help. When a car came by, she lay down in front of it. When the driver got out, Lulu led him back to the camper. The man called for help and Mrs. Altsman was taken to hospital.\n\nSugar, the Cat \n\n Sugar was a beautiful cat. Three years ago she wandered onto the Woods' farm in California and Mrs. Woods began feeding her. Mrs. Woods noticed something wrong with the cat's left leg, but this didn't make Sugar any less special. Mrs. Woods loved Sugar. Later the couple moved to a new farm in Oklahoma. They gave Sugar to a neighbor who would take good care of her, because they knew she wouldn't like riding in cars for days. However, Sugar walked across deserts and mountains and traveled more than 1,500 miles to the Woods' new farm! Mr. and Mrs. Woods could hardly believe their eyes. No one knows how Sugar found her way to Oklahoma.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:How did Thumper help Benjamin?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why did Lulu lie down on the road?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What did Sugar do in the story?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/4nc5c303300579.html"},

Today it's also one of the most written languages online. And with so many Chinese people interested in learning English, it couldn't be easier to find a friend for language learning.

If you sign on with your address set to \"abroad\", you'll soon find that many thousands of them are interested in speaking to you!

So do humans. When you see an apple or a piece of chocolate you know that these are things you can eat. You can also use other senses when you choose\u00a0your food. You may like it because it smells good or because it tastes good. You may dislike some types of\u00a0food because they do not look, smell or taste very nice. Different animals use different senses to find and\u00a0choose their food. A few animals depend on only one of their senses, while most animals use more than one\u00a0sense.\u00a0\n\n Although there are many different types of food, some animals spend their lives eating only one type. The\u00a0giant panda eats only one particular type of bamboo. Other animals eat only one type of food\u00a0even when given the choice. A kind of white butterfly will stay on the leaves of a cabbage, even though\u00a0there are plenty of other vegetables in the garden. However, most animals have a more \n\ndiet. The bear eats fruits and fish. The fox eats small animals, birds and fruits. The diet of these animals will be different depending on the season.\u00a0\n\n Humans have a very varied diet. We often eat food because we like it and not because it is good for us. In countries such as France and Britain, people eat foods with too much sugar. This makes them overweight,\u00a0which is bad for their health. Eating too much red meat and animal products, such as butter, can also be bad\u00a0for the health.

The fire can grow more quickly if you open the door.\n\n*Stay close to the floor. Smoke can be more dangerous than fire. The best air is near the floor because smoke rises.\n\n*What should you do if your hair or clothes start to burn? First, stop. Don't run! The fire burns faster because of more air.

Immediately I came alive, I decided to wave back.\n\n From then on my journey became interesting. I threw my magazines into the waste basket and decided to join in Malaysian life.

I looked at my watch and was surprised that it was 3:00 pm. Soon the train pulled up at Butterworth. When my uncle arrived, I threw my arms around him to give him a warm hug.

What do they do in their free time? \n\n On April 8, a report came out on the lives of high school students in China, Japan, South Korea and the US. It surveyed around 6,200 students from the four countries last year. You will find the answers to many of your questions in this report.\n\n Who studies hardest?\n\n Chinese students spend the most time studying. Nearly half of Chinese students spend more than two hours on their homework every day. That's much more than students of the US (26.4%), Japan (8.2%) and South Korea (5.2%). \n\n Who sleeps most often in class?\n\n Japanese students fall asleep in class most often. About 45% of them said they sometimes \n\nin class. In South Korea, it's 32%; in the US, 21%; and 5% in China. \n\n South Korean students don't like taking notes. About 70% said they write down what the teacher says in class, much fewer than in Japan (93%), China (90%) and the US (89%).\n\n Who is the most distracted (\u5206\u5fc3\u7684)? \n\n American students are the most active in class, but also the most distracted: 64.2% said they chat with friends in class; 46.9% said they eat snacks in class; and 38.9% said they send e-mails or read unrelated (\u65e0\u5173\u7684) books in class.\n\n What do they do after school?\n\n In their free time, most Chinese students study or surf the Internet.

Before your first day, find out if your new job has a dress code (rules about what you can wear to work). If so, be sure to follow it. No matter what, always be neat and clean.\n\n2. Get to work on time. Give yourself an extra 15 minutes to make sure you arrive on time.\n\n3. Pay attention to introductions. One of the first things that your \n\n may do is to introduce you to co-workers. These co-workers will be important to you. They are the ones who will answer your questions when the boss is not around.\n\n4. Ask plenty of questions. Make sure that your supervisor has told you what is expected of you. If he or she has not told you your duties, ask for a list. Set daily and weekly goals for yourself.\n\n5. Never be the first one to leave. Watch what your co-workers do around quitting time (\u4e0b\u73ed\u65f6\u95f4).\u00a0 It does not look good for you to be eager(\u6025\u5207) to leave.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: Before you arrive at work, you should \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: According to the passage, which of the following statements is True?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, your \n\n is most likely your \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/j7vtc303300096.html"},

Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers.\n\n Q: Why is the sky blue?\n\n A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits \u201craised area\u201d in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules (\u5206\u5b50) because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters (\u4f7f\u5206\u6563) it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. \n\n Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime?\n\n A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit (\u8f68\u9053) around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us.\n\n Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter?\n\n A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50\u00b0F. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive \uff08\u8702\u5de2\uff09and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The sky looks blue mainly because the color blue in the sunlight\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:How long can't the moon be seen during the daytime in a month?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What do honeybees choose to do when the temperature drops below 50\u00b0F?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is NOT explained in the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/tplsc303300143.html"},

Some people have shown us that it's not. But people have also changed the ways in which they help others. \n\nLi Yulin, who works in a hospital in Hang Zhou, Zhejiang, has been a volunteer for 15 years. He still remembers his experience in an old people's home several years ago. An old woman held his hand and said, \u201cYou don't need to do anything for us. Seeing young people like you here is all we need.\u201d Those words made Li think: in what ways can we help people better? \u201cEvery person does what they can, no matter how small it is, to give out positive energy.

He needed a lot of money for an operation. He was not asking for donations, but hoped people would come to eat at his restaurant. Li's post spread quickly.

A floor map could be programmed into the computer's memory, for example.\n\n A mobile robot will not be able to do everything. Unlike human guards, it will not be able to climb stairs, open doors, or move along rough ground. It won't be able to tell the difference between friends and enemies.

He was short and couldn't grip(\u6293) anything. Suddenly the bus stopped and the boy nearly fell to the floor. He looked around and saw Mr. King's beard and gripped it.

In some countries, there is a special day for playing tricks on others. In North America and parts of Europe, this day is known as April Fool's Day, and is celebrated on April 1.\n\nMany people believe that the French started April Fool's Day. Centuries ago, New Year's Day in Europe was April 1. In 1582, the calendar changed and King Charles IX of France moved it to January 1.\n\nSome people did not like this, and chose to keep April 1 as New Year's Day. Many called these people \u2018April fools' and played jokes and tricks on them. Over time, April 1 became a day to have fun in France. It then spread to England and Scotland, and later, to North America.\n\nOn April Fool's Day, jokes are common. In the United States, for example, a person may move a friend's clock ahead one hour, or change the sugar and salt. In Scotland, April Fool's Day lasts for two days. The second day is called \u2018Taily Day'\u2500for one's \u2018tail'. On this day, people might secretly put a sign saying \u2018kick me' on a person's back or behind. Other countries have their own \u2018Fool's Day'. In Spain and Mexico, people play tricks on each other on December 28. In India, it happens on March 31.\n\nIn many countries around the world, April 1 is a day of fun.

If you don't think you can speak to them at the moment, try writing a letter.\n\n Try to reach a compromise(\u548c\u89e3). Perhaps you and your parents disagree on something. You can keep your disagreement and try your best to accept each other. Michael's mother didn't agree with him about buying a motorcycle. They argued over it. But they finally came to a compromise. Michael bought the motorcycle, but only drove it on certain days.\n\n Of course, your parents might refuse to compromise on something. In these situations, it is especially important to show love and respect(\u5c0a\u656c) to them. Showing respect will keep your relationship strong.\n\n Talk about your values.

Why do people use the Internet to shop? Some people say it is more convenient.

Still other people say they can find better prices on the Internet.\n\nIf you want to buy something on the Internet, you need a credit (\u4fe1\u7528) card. You have to type your credit card number and information on the website (\u7f51\u9875) and send them to the store over the Internet. You have to be sure that the store will not use your information in the wrong way. You don't want someone to get your credit card number, so be careful with it, because people sometimes steal (\u5077) credit card numbers from stores.\n\nTV Internet is also a good place to go window-shopping. Window-shopping is when you look at the things for sale in a store, but don't plan to buy anything. In window-shopping you can see what kinds of things you are able to get and how much they cost. Some stores like Ross Stores have a website for information about their Mores, but not for shopping.

He got the idea after he finished a long bike ride. Gregg's friend, Brooks Allen, also liked riding a bike. The two friends talked and made a plan: they would travel from Alaska to Argentina \u2013 by bike.\n\nTo pay for the trip, Gregg and Brooks worked to save money for a long time. Once they were on the road, they often camped outdoors and ate cheaply. In many places, local people opened their doors to the two friends and gave them food.\n\nOn their way, they passed deserts, rainforests and mountains. They visited modern cities and ancient ruins (\u9057\u8ff9) such as Machu Picchu in Peru. And they made many friends from all over the world.\n\n In May 2007 \u2013 two years, twelve countries, and over 30,500 kilometres later \u2013 Gregg finally reached Ushuaia, Argentina. (Near Guatemala, Brooks had to go back and Gregg continued without him.)\n\nThe trip taught both men a lot about traveling. What did they learn? Here is some of Gregg's advice:\n\nTravel light. You should carry many things with you.\n\nBe flexible (\u7075\u6d3b). Don't plan everything. Then you'll be more relaxed, especially if there are problems.\n\nBe polite.

And so it has gone, every week for three years.

Our Saturdays now feel like mini-vacations. We drive our car or ride our bike. We, with our kids, work in the garden, play board games and cook meals. I feel more balanced. I feel like a better mother, wife and person.\n\nKeeping a balance between the good and the bad of technology is my lasting state. The technology we've created makes it possible for us to share knowledge and take in carious ideas all over the world. But the technology also take something away from us. When we stay up late at night linking(\u8fde\u63a5) from website to website or sending messages or e-mailing, we click again, and again, and again until we've overloaded(\u8d85\u8d1f\u8377\u7684).\n\nWhen we rush into the time full of high technology, it's necessary for us to pay attention to what we are doing online and when we should go off.\n\nI will always remember the most important thing in my family: \u201cTechnology Shabbat\".\n\n When is \u201cTechtwhgy Shabbat' in the writer's family?\n\n The writer's family have \u201cTechnology Shabbat\" every week mainly becausc they hope to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n What do the writers family NOT do during their \u201cTechnology Shubbats\u201d?\n\n", "answer": "", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/uf4wc303298346.html"},

Here and there, now and then, everyone needs courage to do something well. Courage may make you confident of your success. If you have courage, you will not show fear in face of anything difficult or dangerous. With courage, you mak look someone in the eye who you have wronged and say \u201cI am sorry\u201d: you may still smile even if you are seriously ill and know you are at the end of your life.\n\nHow can we build up our courage?\n\nBelieve you will be successful. Take chances and know that you have your own talents. Besides, your family and friends are always there for you.\n\nExercise your courage. It can be compared to a muscle(\u808c\u8089). The more we use it, the stronger courage gets.\n\nKnow that giving up is not a choice. It's much easier to give up, and it takes courage to say or do what you think is right, even when other people think you are wrong.\n\nFight to control your fear. Courageous people may still be afraid, but the differnce is that they can control their fear. \n\nThey don't let it hold them back but use it as a reminder of what they can lose if they don't go on.\n\nGet courage by reading inspiring stories of brave people.

Since nobody was in the room with Rico, he had no help from anyone finding the right toy. The researchers did this test forty times. Rico found the right toy thirty-seven times!\n\n Then the researchers tried something else. They put seven of Rico's toys in the room together with one new toy that Rico had never seen before.

Rico found the right toy seven out of ten times!\n\n Researchers cannot really say that Rico knows words or language.

Scientists wanted to see how well their bodies worked when they had eaten different kinds of breakfasts.\n\nThe results show that if a person eats a right breakfast, he or she will work better than if he or she has no breakfast. If a student has fruit, egg, bread and milk before going to school, he will learn more quickly and listen more carefully.\n\nThe result is opposite to what some people think.

The following are more of the new rules. \n\nTell the truth. Have you ever copied \n\n\u00a0work in an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something \n\n\u00a0students should do. If you are playing computer games in your room, don't tell your parents you are doing homework.\n\nDo more activities at school. Good students love animals and \n\n\u00a0others. April is Bird Loving Month in China. Is your school doing anything to celebrate it? You should join! That way you can learn more about animals and \n\n\u00a0them. When more people work together, it brings us more \n\n.\n\nLearn to co-operate. When your basketball team is \n\n, only working together can make your team \n\n. Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself.\n\nBe open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll \n\n\u00a0Earth \u2161 someday. Don't look down upon new ideas. All the ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone.\n\nPay attention to your safety. You should not walk \n\n\u00a0outside, especially at night. \n\nwhere the public phones are. If \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ happens, you can find them quickly. If you take a bus to a place far away, please don't sleep. This stops a stranger from \n\n\u00a0money from you.\n\nUse the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for your studies. \n\n\u00a0not everything on the Internet is fit for kids. You may enter healthy websites for your homework or just for fun.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n\u5c0f\u98985:D\n\u5c0f\u98986:B\n\u5c0f\u98987:B\n\u5c0f\u98988:D\n\u5c0f\u98989:A\n\u5c0f\u989810:C\n\u5c0f\u989811:A\n\u5c0f\u989812:C\n\u5c0f\u989813:D\n\u5c0f\u989814:D\n\u5c0f\u989815:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/d1kmc303296022.html"},

If so, you probably need help to make the bigger choices in your life, like what to do when you're older. Brave New Girls, by American author Jean Gade-berg, will help you make such choices. It says you must be a brave new girl. A brave new girl is one who is confident, healthy and happy. A brave new girl can realize her dreams. To be brave, you need to make a decision for yourself. Other people may tell you what to do, but you should not listen to them. You must only do what you want. If you always wear clothes like your favourite TV star, you must stop doing so. Instead, become your own star and wear the clothes you want. You have to like your body, it says. If you don't, you will not take good care of it, and it won't stay healthy. The book also says that girls must start becoming more confident. If you are confident, you'll succeed in life. A good way to become confident is to realize that you are as clever as boys.

The following steps will help you.\n\nBe friendly. You need to be friendly so that people feel good when they stay with you. You should often use body language to make them know that you are friendly. Often smile and laugh, and make eye contact(\u4ea4\u6d41).\n\nBe a good listener. Listen carefully to what people say, remember important things about them (their names, their likes and dislikes), ask questions about their interests, and just take time to learn more about them.\n\nThe steps above are great for making new friends, but how about making lifelong(\u4e00\u751f\u7684) friends?\n\nBe trustworthy(\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684). The key to being a good friend is to keep secrets. If other people ask you to keep a secret, you shouldn't tell anyone about it. When you say you'll do something, please do it.\n\nBe there. If a friend needs help, or if he just needs a shoulder to cry on, be there. \n\nBe true to yourself. You should never do anything that you think is wrong. Keep true to yourself.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:make more friends\n\u5c0f\u98982:body language\n\u5c0f\u98983:good listeners\n\u5c0f\u98984:secrets\n\u5c0f\u98985:Be there\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/ao11c303307635.html"},

Ever since middle school, my sister Wang Wei and I have dreamed about taking a great bike trip. Two years ago she bought an expensive mountain bike and then she persuaded me to buy one. Last year, she visited our cousins, Dao Wei and Yu Hang at their college in Kunming. They are Dai(\u50a3\u65cf\u4eba) and grew up in western Yunnan Province near the Lancang River, the Chinese part of the river that is called the Mekong River in other countries. Wang Wei soon got them interested in bike riding too. After graduating from college, we finally got the chance to take a bike trip. I asked my sister, \"Where are we going?\" It was my sister who first had the idea to ride along the whole Mekong River from where it begins to where it ends. Now she is planning our schedule for the trip. \n\nMy sister has one serious shortcoming(\u7f3a\u70b9). She can be really stubborn(\u56fa\u6267\u7684). Although she didn't know the best way of getting to places, she insisted(\u575a\u6301) that she organize the trip properly. Now, I know that the proper way is always her way. I kept asking her, \"When are we leaving and when are we coming back?\" I asked her whether she had looked at a map yet. Of course, she hadn't; my sister doesn't care about details(\u7ec6\u8282). So I told her that the source (\u6e90\u5934)of the Mekong River is in Qinghai Province. She gave me a determined look\u2014the kind that said she would not change her mind. When I told her that our journey would begin at an altitude of more than 5,000 metres, she seemed to be excited about it. When I told her the air would be hard to breathe(\u547c\u5438) and it would be very cold, she said it would be an interesting experience. I know my sister well. Once she has made up her mind, nothing can change it. Finally, I had to give in.\n\nSeveral months before our trip, Wang Wei and I went to the library. We found a large atlas with good maps that showed details of world geography. From it we could see that the Mekong River begins in a glacier on a mountain in Qinghai Province. At first the river is small and the water is clear and cold. Then it begins to move quickly. It becomes rapids as it passes through deep valleys, travelling across western Yunnan Province. Sometimes the river becomes a waterfall. We were both surprised to learn that half of the river is in China. After it leaves China, the Mekong becomes wide, brown and warm. As it enters Southeast Asia, its pace slows. At last, the river delta enters the South China Sea.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Who planned the trip to the Mekong River?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The Mekong River\u00a0 begins from\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, which of the following can you see when you travel along the Mekong River\u00a0 ?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following is NOT TURE according to the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:What do you think is the best title of the passage ?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/igh2c303313735.html"},

I noticed that she was \n\n\u00a0digging to bring the apples to the surface so they could be seen \n\n\u00a0the snow. I wondered why she was doing this. She seemed to be completely busy with some kind of important task to find as many \n\n\u00a0as possible during her yard time.\n\n, she had one apple in her mouth when I called her back into the house. About five minutes later I looked outside. The yard was completely covered with birds. Lucky had \n\n\u00a0all those apples for her bird and squirrel friends to eat.

All family members should know how to turn off gas, water and electricity and know useful telephone numbers ( doctor, hospital, police and 119 etc.). Never put heavy things over beds.\n\n During an earthquake\u00a0\u00a0 It is important for each of you to stay calm. If you are indoors, quickly move to a safe place in the room such as under a strong desk or table. The purpose is to protect yourself from falling things. Stay away from windows, large mirrors, heavy fumiture and so on. If you are cooking, turn off the gas. If you are outdoors, move to an open area like a playground. Move away from buildings, bridges and trees. If you are driving, stop the car as soon as possible, staying away from bridges and tall buildings, stay in your car.\n\n After an earthquake\u00a0 ONCE the shaking has stopped, DO NOT run out of the building at once. It is better to wait and leave when it is safe. Check around you and help the people who are in trouble. If your building is badly broken, you should leave it. If you smell or hear gas, get everyone outside and open windows and doors. If you can do it safely, turn off the gas.

And how he answers will let you know how far you can go.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSecond, once good talkers have asked questions, they listen to the answers. This point seems clear, but it isn't. Your questions should have a point and help to tell what sort of person you are talking to. And to find out, you really have to listen carefully and attentively. Real listening at least means some things. First it means not to change the subject of conversation. If someone sticks to one topic, you can take it as a fact that he's really interested in it. Real listening also means not just listening to words, but to tones of voice. If the voice sounds dull, then, it's time for you to change the subject.\n\nFinally, good talkers know well how to deal with the moment of parting. If you're saying good-bye, you may give him a firm handshake and say, \"I've really enjoyed meeting you.\" If you want to see that person again, don't keep it a secret. Let people know what you feel, and they may walk away feeling as if they've known you half their life.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Asking questions might be a quite good and suitable way \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:After having asked somebody a question, it'll be polite of you to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Generally speaking, good talkers are persons who \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:If you really want to meet someone again, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/tjgjc203314188.html"},

Yes, I'm enjoying myself on my exchange program in France. It's even better than I thought it would be. I was a bit nervous before I arrived here, but there was no reason to be. My host family are really nice. They go out of their way to make me feel at home. And you wouldn't believe how quickly my French has improved! I'm very comfortable speaking French now. Although I still make lots of mistakes, it doesn't make me worried as it used to. My biggest challenge (\u6311\u6218) is learning how to behave (\u8868\u73b0) at the dinner table. As you can imagine, things are really not the same as the way they are at home. For example, you shouldn't put your bread on your plate. You should put it on the table! I thought that was very strange at first, but now I'm used to it. You shouldn't eat anything with your hands except bread, not even fruit! (You have to cut it up and eat it with a fork.) Another thing is that it is very rude to say you're full. If you don't want any more food, you should just say, \u201cIt was delicious.\u201d Also, it's rude to put your hands in your lap. You should always keep your hands, but not your elbows (\u8098\u90e8), on the table. I have to say, I find it difficult to remember everything, but I'm gradually getting used to things and don't find them so strange any more. \n\nI'll write soon and tell you more about life in France.

In fact, \n\n for a change: Ask about their day \u2014 just as they do with you. \n\nDavid, 16, is a senior school student. One evening, after he mentioned at dinner that he was thinking of trying out for the school play, his mom kept asking about it for weeks.

Instead of telling his mom how he felt, David decided it would be easier not to tell her anything he was doing in the future. \n\nA good way to get a parent to ask fewer questions is to offer some information on your own. This puts the communication in your hands. The more you keep a parent told about everyday things, the less they need to ask. Communicating everyday things has another advantage: It can show your parents that you're responsible enough to make good decisions. \n\nIt won't always be easy. You may get frustrated (\u53d7\u632b) at times. But try not to give up. It may take a bit for a parent who is used to making all the decisions to adjust (\u9002\u5408) to the independent-thinking person their child is becoming. Parents also don't want to see their sons and daughters suffer (\u53d7\u82e6) if the choices they make on their own aren't the \u201cright\u201d ones. To many parents, it seems easier to step in and take control simply because they believe their years of experience put them in a better position to make decisions.

I enjoy the things you sell, such as the selection of produce (\u519c\u4ea7\u54c1) and fresh bakery items. I have been a long time supermarket shopper and hope to continue for many years.

I can find other flavors (\u5473\u9053) of soup, but your store does not carry nacho cheese soup, a common ingredient (\u539f\u6599) in many of my recipes. In addition, I can only find large wonton wrappers (\u9984\u9968\u76ae), while many other stores carry both large and small and offer a more varied selection for their customers.

They are eating in a restaurant with their parents. They finished the spaghetti minutes ago. Now, they are bored. Their little brother is kicking them under the table. He is also complaining about the desserts(\u9910\u540e\u751c\u70b9). Yet their parents are still eating and talking\u2026and talking\u2026and talking.\n\n\u201cBe patient.\u201d One parent says. \u201cWe'll have dessert soon.\u201d\n\nAll kids know what happens next. After dessert, their parents drink coffee. Then they talk some more. Again, the children must wait. They have been in school all day and would rather be running and playing. Instead, they must sit in a chair and stare at a wall.\n\nGoing to a restaurant doesn't have to be this way. Many restaurants say they are \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d. Family restaurants, such as fast-food restaurants should play areas for children. At these restaurants, almost every play area is a big room full of climbing equipment. The room is usually, packed with happy kids. Parents can eat while the children play. Everyone is happy.\n\nThe real problem begins when families want to eat a fancier meal(\u5927\u9910). The parents don't want to hurry through the meal but talk to each other. They do not have bored children pestering(\u70e6\u6270) them about leaving. That's no fun for kids either. For them, going to a nicer restaurant means just one thing: sit still and be quiet.\n\nOn family blogs across the Web, dozens of parents post the same question all the time; are there any nicer restaurants with play areas for kids? Research shows that some nicer restaurants do have play areas. In warmer cities, it is easier for restaurants to build play areas outside. For example, at one restaurant kids can sail tiny little motor boats in a small, shallow pond. Parents can sit on a beautiful yard and watch the kids play. Some nicer restaurants even have indoor play areas. Research also shows that these restaurants serve more than just burgers, chickens and fries.\n\nSo, it's possible for a restaurant to provide both food and a place where kids can play.

I'm a bit nervous as I've never made a speech before to so many people, so please forgive me if it shows! \n\n As we all know, this is the school leavers' party, and it's time to say goodbye to everyone. We're sorry to leave you at the end of our junior high school education, and we promise that we'll never forget the happy times we have spent in these buildings with you all.\n\n I'd like to thank three groups of people for the three things I've learnt while I've been a pupil at our school. The three things are friendship, love and knowledge.\n\n The first group is my friends, and what I've learnt is the importance of friendship. We've worked hard together, we've even shared some difficult times together, but we've also had a lot of fun. Many of us will go to new schools and we may not see each other so often in the future. Others will go on to senior high school and continue their close friendships. But friends don't have to see each other all the time. Sometimes the friends you treasure most are the friends you see less often. A life without old friends is like a day without sunshine. We'll always stay in touch.\n\n The second group is our parents and grandparents. We thank you for the love you have shown us during our years at junior high school, for making a home where we feel both safe and relaxed, and where we can prepare ourselves for our school days. We also thank you for your help with our homework. How many of us owe our good grades to the suggestions you have made during those long evenings?\n\n And finally, the third group is our teachers. We can never pay you back for your kindness, your patience, and gift of knowledge which you have offered us; sometimes you've made us work very hard. But you have always been fair and you'll always be our role models. There's a saying from Ireland which is a favourite of mine: Strangers are only friends you haven't met yet.\n\nI couldn't say it better myself.

Most of us have done this in our own room when we were kids or even when we grew up. Me? I love to do that when I drive! I turn on the radio, find a song that I can sing along, and soon my arms are in the air. I am moving along to the music. Most of the time, I do this on my way to work.\n\nYes, that is true. I will be in my nice work clothes in my car. Someone may look at me strangely or even laugh at me when I stopped at a traffic light. Personally I love to get lost in the music. That can lead me to share with you the importance of being silly!\n\nThe meaning of the word silly, according to the dictionary is : stupid, foolish and nonsensical. I know many people do not want to look foolish. So they are always serious in their life, but in fact that is really stupid.\n\nNo one is perfect, I repeat: no one is perfect. I don't care how educated, how thin, how beautiful, how simple, how frugal(\u6734\u7d20\u7684), how rich, and so on \u2026 No one is perfect! So why pretend(\u5047\u88c5) to be something you are not?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLife is so short\u2026\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, so why waste a single second on being so \u201cperfect\u201d?\n\nWhen we were kids, we had no idea of fear and we had no care in the world so we could do things without worrying about how we appeared to others. However, as we grew up, we lost that kind of feeling. \n\nSo don't be afraid to be silly. The next time you feel down, go and turn on your favourite song , sing and dance along just like there is no tomorrow. Or watch something that makes you laugh. Trust me, you will feel a whole lot better, and who doesn't want to feel good.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:While driving to work, the writer often \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does the writer want to tell us in Paragraph Two?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following can be put in the blank in Paragraph Five?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following might be the best title for the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/tp49c203313345.html"},

For example, the lions must eat meat; the giraffes will eat grass and leaves; and the parrots must have fruit and nuts. Sometimes some animals won't let the others eat their food. If this happens, each of them must be fed separately(\u5206\u79bb\u7684). Every morning the zoo keepers must clean each cage. This can be dangerous, especially(\u5c24\u5176) with lions and tigers. To make the work easier, the keepers always lock the animals in the sleeping compartments(\u9694\u95f4) while they are washing the cages. When the animals are sick, the zoo keepers must look after them. Each sick animal is kept in a separate cage and given medicine. Sometimes the zoo workers have to inject(\u6ce8\u5c04) the sick animals, even the lions.\n\nAll the keepers live near the zoo. Each of them has a small house. There he lives with his family.

One has a destination\uff08\u76ee\u7684\u5730\uff09in mind (her goal) which can be found on a map. She can drive straight there without any wasted time or wrong turns.

After lessons, we have 2 hours of activity time, when you can choose from a number of activities, including many sports, such as rugby(\u82f1\u5f0f\u6a44\u6984\u7403) , football, basketball and tennis.\n\nAs a boarder(\u5bc4\u5bbf\u8005), the quality of food is something I consider very important, and Merchiston has not \n\n. The school kitchens are run by a professional company, and the quality of food is excellent, and they are always trying to make the diet healthy.

One of my friends explained that a gentleman will pour the lemonade for the ladies and show other good manners.\n\n Toward the end of my three-week trip, I was invited by my Russian friend Nicolai Vasilevich and his wife Yulya out to dinner. At the end of a wonderful meal, Yulya asked if I would like a banana. I politely declined(\u5a49\u8c22) and thanked her, and explained I was most satisfied with the meal. But my mind was racing: \"What should I do? Should I offer her a banana though they are as close to her as they are to me? What is the polite thing to do?\"\n\n \"Would you like a banana?\" I asked Yulya.\n\n \"Yes,\" she smiled, but didn't try to take any of the three bananas in the fruit basket.\n\n \"Which one would you like?\" I asked again.\n\n \"That one,\" she pointed at one of the bananas. So thinking about Russian politeness, f picked the banana Yulya had pointed at. Then I \n\n it half way and handed it to her.Smiles on Yulya's and Nicolai's faces told me I had done the right thing. Alter this experience, I spent much time letting the world know that in Russia, the polite thing was to peel bananas for ladies.\n\n However, sometime during my third trip i learned I was wrong.\n\n \"Oh no, David,\" a Russian politely corrected me.\u00a0 \"In Russia, when a man peels a banana for a lady, it means he has a romantic interest in her.\"\u00a0How embarrassed (\u5c34\u5c2c) I felt.\n\n So to communicate properly with people of different cultures, we should watch carefully how people of the same culture communicate with each other.
