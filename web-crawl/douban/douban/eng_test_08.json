In 1826, a Frenchman named Niepce needed pictures for his business. But he was not a good artist. So he invented a very simple camera. He put it in a window of his house and took a picture of his garden. That was the first photograph.\n\nThe next important date in the history of photograph was 1837. That year, Daguerre, another Frenchman, took a picture of his studio. He used a new kind of camera and a different process. In his pictures, you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest details. This kind of photograph was called a daguerreotype.\n\nSoon, other people began to use Daguerre's process. Travelers brought back daguerreotypes from all around the world. People photographed famous buildings, cities and mountains.\n\nIn about 1840, the process was improved. The photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. The process was not simple. The photographers had to carry lots of films and processing equipment(\u8bbe\u5907). But this did not stop the photographers, especially in the United States. \n\nMathew Brady was a well-known American photographer. He took many pictures of famous people. The pictures were unusual because they were very life-like and full of personality. Brady was also the first person to take pictures of war. His 1862 Civil War pictures showed dead soldiers and destroyed cities. They made the war seem more real and more terrible.\n\nIn the 1880s, new inventions began to change photograph. Photographers could buy films readymade in rolls(\u5377). So they did not have to make the film themselves. Also, they did not have to process(\u51b2\u6d17) the film at once. They could bring it back to their studios and develop it later. They did not have to carry lots of equipment. And finally, the invention of the small hand-held camera made photography less expensive.\n\nPhotography is also a form of art. Some photographs were not just copies of the real world. They showed ideas and feelings, like other art forms.\n\nTitle: The \n\nof Photography\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:development\n\u5c0f\u98982:taken\n\u5c0f\u98983:clear\n\u5c0f\u98984:terrible\n\u5c0f\u98985:cheap\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/r2lkc303272998.html"},

Thanks to computers, movie makers can now use their full imaginations. There's even a new type of character--made entirely by computers\u2014which is getting more and more screen time.\n\n Making the impossible look easy has always been a part of movie magic. As far back as 1895, filmmakers used special effects in movies. Over the years, many few techniques\uff08\u6280\u672f\uff09 were developed. Then, starting in the 1970s, computers took their place at the center of the process.\n\n One of the first movies to widely use 3D computer generated\uff08\u751f\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\uff09 imagery (CGI) was \n\n(1982). In the following years, more CGI characters were brought to life, one by one. Then, \n\n (1993) brought us an island full of man-eating dinosaurs. Shortly afterwards, \n\n (1995) became the first cartoon made entirely with 3D CGI effects. It was a big\n\n and audiences loved the characters.\n\n By using \u201cmotion capture\u201d technology, filmmakers can make the movements of CGI humans even more lifelike. With this technique, a real actor wears sensors\uff08\u611f\u53d7\u5668\uff0c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff09 on his face and body. The sensors record the actor's movements and send the information to a computer. Then the movements are given to a CGI character. This technique was used to make the creature\uff08\u751f\u7269\uff0c\u6709\u751f\u547d\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff09 Gollum in the second and third \n\n movies (2002,2003). Other films, like \n\n(2007), have also used motion capture to help create CGI humans.\n\n It is still rather easy to tell that a CGI human is not real. But the technology is improving every year. Over time, many problems ( like the teeth and eyes looking fake) will be solved. We will certainly see more CGI animals, monsters, and people in movies and TV shows.

You never know which one you will get, so there isn't a cure for each one.\n\n When a virus attacks your body, the body works hard to get rid of it. Blood rushes to your nose and brings congestion(\u5145\u8840)with it .You feel terrible because you can't breathe well, but your body is actually \"eating\" the virus. Your temperature rises and you get a fever, but the heat of your body is killing the virus.

They use all of their senses to learn about the sights, sounds, tastes, and smells in their environments. They learn how to communicate with their parents, grandparents, \n\n, friends, and other people important to their world. When they enter school, children learn subjects like reading, writing, and maths. They also continue to learn a lot outside the classroom. They learn which behaviors are likely to be rewarded and which are likely to be punished. They learn social skills for communicating with other children. After they finish school, people must learn to deal with many changes that affect their lives, such as getting married, raising children, and finding and keeping a job. \n\n Because learning continues throughout our lives and affects almost everything we do, the study of learning is important in many different fields. Teachers need to understand the best ways to educate children. Scientists, social workers and other human service workers need to understand how certain experiences change people's behaviors. \n\n Learning is closely related (\u76f8\u5173\u7684) to memory, which is the storage of information in the brain (\u5927\u8111).

Deer leave high ground and come down from the mountains.\n\nBirds are especially good weather indicators because they also show the effect of a pressure drop in many ways. For example, some birds become irritable(\u66b4\u8e81) and quarrelsome and will fight over a piece of bread. Other birds chirp and sing just before a storm. It seems they know they won't get another chance for an hour or two. Birds also look for safe places before a storm.

He says, \u201cA person who uses an electronic device blinks about one third as much as we normally do in everyday life. And so that can result in the front part of the eye drying and not staying protected like normal.\u201d\n\nEye doctors offer suggestions like following which is known as the 20/20/20 rule. That means every twenty minutes look away twenty feet or more for at least twenty seconds from whatever device you're using.\n\nOther suggestions include putting more distance between you and the device and using good lighting. Of course, another way is to spend less time looking at screens. Many experts say children should spend no more than two hours a day using digital devices\u2014with no screen time for children under two.\n\nBut not all eye doctors have noticed an increase in problems in children.

Music is nice, people seem to say, but not important. Too often it is only viewed as entertainment, but certainly not an education priority\uff08\u4f18\u5148\uff09. This view is shortsighted. In fact, music education is very important for all students.\n\nMusic tells us who we are. Because music is an expression of the beings who create it, it shows their thinking and values, as well as the social environment it came from. Rock music represents a lifestyle just as surely as does a Schubert song. The jazz influence that George Gershwin and other musicians introduced into their music is obviously American because it came from American musical traditions. Music expresses our character and values. It gives us identity\uff08\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u7279\u6027\uff09as a society. \n\nMusic provides a kind of perception\uff08\u611f\u77e5\uff09that cannot be acquired any other way. Science can explain how the sun rises and sets. The arts can express the emotive\uff08\u60c5\u611f\u7684\uff09meaning of the same thing. We need every possible way to discover and respond to our world for one simple but powerful reason: No one way can get it all.\n\nThe arts are forms of thought as powerful in what they communicate as mathematical and scientific symbols. They are ways we human beings \u201ctalk\u201d to each other. They are the language through which we express our fears, our hungers, our discoveries, our hopes. The arts are ways we give form to our ideas and imagination so that they can be shared with others. When we do not give children an important way of expressing themselves such as music, we take away from them the meanings that music expresses.\n\nScience and technology do not tell us what it means to be human. The arts do. Music is an important way we express human suffering, celebration, the value of peace and love. \n\nSo music education is far more necessary than people seem to realize.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What can we learn from Paragraph 1?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:In Paragraph 2, the writer uses jazz as an example to\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, the arts and science\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is the main idea of the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/5dghc303273785.html"},

It is three-dimensional(3D), so you may have to wear a special pair of glasses to see it. The 3D glasses make the images(\u56fe\u50cf) from the movie look like they are coming straight at you.\n\nMore and more 3D movies are coming to theaters. 3D TV sets have been produced in Japan now. Three-dimensional technology can make TV and movies more exciting. But people with eye problems may get headaches if they spend too much time watching 3D movies.\n\nWhen we look at an object(\u7269\u4f53), each eye sees it at a different angle(\u89d2\u5ea6). Our eyes send the two images to our brain(\u5927\u8111), and the brain puts them together. That's how we see depth(\u6df1\u5ea6). So when we watch a 3D movie, one film projector(\u6295\u5f71\u673a) projects a left eye image and the other projects a right eye image. 3D glasses allow us to see a different image in each eye.\n\nThere are a lot of people walking around with very less serious eye problems. Under normal situations, the brain can adjust to their eyes so they can see things normally.\n\nBut when they are watching a 3D movie, the images projected to their eyes can't be put together by their brain. So the brain needs to work harder at reading the images. That makes it easier for these people to get headaches.\n\nDr John Hagan, an eye doctor in Kansas City, said some people who do not see depth normally cannot see in 3D at all.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:When people want to watch a three-dimensional movie, they need \n\n\u00a0.\n\nA. a ticket\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B. a pair of 3D glasses\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C. an earphone\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Three-dimensional technology uses \n\n\u00a0film projector(s) to project one movie at the same time.\n\nA. one\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B. two\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C. three\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, if we look at an object by only one eye, we can't judge the \n\n\u00a0excatly.\n\nA. image\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B. angle\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C. depth\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which statement is TRUE according to the passage?\n\nA.

Robert Stickgold is a professor of psychiatry (\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6559\u6388). He says that when we dream, the brain is trying to make sense of the world. He does not agree with Sigmund Freud that dreaming is the way we express our hidden feelings and desires(\u613f\u671b).\n\nScientists believe it is important to keep researching dreams.

Some scientists think that waves could help make electricity.\n\n\u201cHave you ever been on a surfboard or boat and felt yourself being lifted up by a wave?\u201d asked Jamie Taylor of the Wave Energy Group in Scotland. \u201cThere is certainly a lot of energy in waves.\u201d\n\nScientists are working on using that energy to make electricity. The United States and a few other countries have started doing research on wave energy, and it is already being used in Scotland.\n\nMost waves are created when winds blow across the ocean. \u201cThe winds start out by making little ripples (\u6ce2\u7eb9) in the water, but if they keep on blowing, those ripples get bigger and bigger and turn into waves,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWaves are one of nature's ways of picking up energy and then sending it off on a journey.\u201d\n\nWhen waves come towards the coast, people can set up dams(\u5927\u575d) to block the water and send it through a large wheel called a turbine(\u6da1\u8f6e). The turbine can then power an electrical generator(\u53d1\u7535\u673a).\n\nWe will never run out of wave power. Besides, wave energy does not create the same pollution as oil and coal do.\n\nOceans cover three quarters of the earth's surface. That would make wave power seem perfect for creating energy around the world. But there are some disadvantages that need us to pay more attention to.\n\nJamie Taylor said that wave power still cost too much money. He said that its influence on animals in the sea is still unknown. Besides, wave power would get in the way of fishing and boat traffic. \n\nWith more research, \u201cMany of these problems might be solved,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cFinding more energy sources(\u8d44\u6e90) is very important, for traditional sources of energy like oil and gas may run out some day.\u201d\n\nIn the future, when you turn on a light button, an ocean wave could be providing the electricity! \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:We can learn from the passage that\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does the fourth paragraph tell us?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What's the writer's attitude towards wave power?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What can be the best title for the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/oycuc303272193.html"},

It's too bad that humans can't hibernate. In fact we almost did.\n\nApparently, at times in the past, farmers in France liked a semi-state of human hibernation. So writes Graham Robb, a British scholar who has studied the sleeping habits of the French farmers. As soon as the weather turned cold, people all over the France shut themselves away and practiced the forgotten art of doing nothing at all for months.\n\nIn line with this, Jeff Warren, a producer at CBC Radio's The Current, tells us that the way we sleep has changed since the invention of lighting.\n\nWhen historians began studying texts of the Middle Ages, they noticed something referred to as \u201cfirst sleep\u201d, which was not clarified, though. Now scientists are telling us our ancestors most likely slept in separate periods. The business of eight hours' continuous sleep is a modern invention.\n\nIn the past, without the artificial light, humans went to sleep when it became dark and then woke themselves up around midnight. The late night period was known as \u201cThe Watch\u201d. It was when people actually kept watch against wild animals, although many of them simply moved around or visited family and neighbors.\n\nAccording to some sleep researchers, a short of insomnia\uff08\u5931\u7720\uff09at midnight is not a disorder. It is normal. Humans can experience another state of consciousness\uff08\u6e05\u9192\u72b6\u6001\uff09around their sleeping, which happens in the brief period before we fall asleep or wake ourselves in the morning. This period can be a creative time for some people. \n\nPlaying with your sleep rhythms\uff08\u8282\u594f\uff09can be dangerous, as worry may set in. Medical science doesn't help much in this case. It offers us medicines for a full night's continuous sleep, which sounds natural; however, according to Warren's theory, it is really the opposite of what we need.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The late night was called \u201cThe Watch\u201d because it was a time for people \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:We can infer from the last paragraph that people should \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What is the writer's purpose in writing the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/kzhqc303272262.html"},

It means that we should go to bed early at night and get up early in the morning. If we do, we shall be healthy. We shall also be rich and clever.\n\nIs this true? Perhaps it is. The body must have enough sleep. Children of your age need ten hours' sleep every night. If you do not go to bed early, you can not have enough sleep. Then you can not think properly and you can not do your work properly. You will not be wise and you may not become wealthy!\n\nSome people go to bed late at night and get up late in the morning. This is not good for them. We should sleep at night when it is dark. The dark helps us to sleep well. When the daylight comes, we should get up. This is the time for exercise. If the body is not used, it will become weak. Exercise keeps it strong.\n\nExercise helps the blood to move around inside the body. This is very important. Blood takes nutrition (\u8425\u517b) to all parts of our bodies. The brains in our heads also need blood. We think with our brains. If we keep our bodies healthy, and take exercise, we can think better!\n\nOur bodies also need air to breathe. Without air we will die. Get up early in the morning and we can have plenty of clean, fresh air.

People who showed feelings were also less likely to tell their doctors that they felt ill.\n\nIn this\u00a0study, Cohen's interviewed 193 adults every day for two weeks. During the interviews, the people were given colds by doctors and had to stay alone in a room for six days.\n\nThe results showed that everyone in the study was equally likely to get ill. But for people who said they felt happy during the research period, their illness are less serious and lasted for a shorter time.\n\nCohen believes that when people experience positive feelings, their body may produce a chemical that helps fight illness and disease.

It is hard for her family to get clean water . Every morning , she leaves home at half past five to get clean water for her family in a village far away . It takes her six hours to get enough clean water for daily cooking and drinking. She has no time to go to school or to play with her friends. Millions of people in the world are like Napoga . They can't get enough clean water to keep healthy. \n\n Earth Day is April 22. But on all other days, we must also remember it. The water we use is the most important natural resource(\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90)on the earth. \n\n Water covers 70 perent of the earth's surface (\u8868\u9762). But most of that is sea water. We can't use it for very many things.\u00a0 Fresh water covers only one percent of the earth's surface. \n\n You probably feel lucky that your life isn't as hard as Napoga's . But that doesn't mean you don't have to worry about water. We all face serious water problems. One of them is water pollution. All kinds of things from cars, factories, farms and homes make our rivers , lakes , and oceans dirty. Polluted water is very bad for people to drink. And dirty water is bad for fish , too. Now, thirty-four percent of all kinds of fish are dying out. \n\n How do cars and factories make our water dirty? First, they pollute the air. Then , when it rains, the rain water comes down and makes our drinking water dirty. Dirty rain, called acid rain(\u9178\u96e8), is also bad for plants ,animals and buildings.\n\nScientists say that in 30 years, more than half of the people in the world won't have enough clean water. We have to learn how to save more water for ourselves\u00a0 and our children. Here is some advice for saving water:\n\n\u25cf Turn off the water while you brush your teeth. You can save as much as 450liters(\u5347)each month. \n\n\u25cf Leaky taps \uff08\u6f0f\u6c34\u7684\u9f99\u5934\uff09waste a lot of water. Fix them right away. \n\n\u25cfYou can easily cut your 10\u2014minute showers in half---and you'll be just as clean.\n\n\u25cfWhen you wash dishes, don't let the water run. \n\n\u25cfOnly wash clothes when you have a lot to wash.

However, there are many possible problems with social networking sites and the teenagers who use them. \n\nApart from the social advantages, social networking sites can be used to record school research, develop artistic talents and experiment with other forms of subject creation. They provide a way to communicate with others who share the same interests and to get helpful advice on ongoing projects.\n\nAlong with these advantages come some dangers. For example, most social networking sites are open to all, especially MySpace, which is the most popular social network among teens in America. It means that they could be put in unpleasant and frightening situations.\n\nA greater danger is that teens may become objects of the people with secret purposes. The secrecy of some social networking sites makes it easy for dangerous people to find young teens and invite them into dangerous conversations. It's easy for them to pretend as teens and draw children into dangerous real-world communication as well. Then further hurt might be on its way. \n\nAnother danger is identity stealing, which can happen when teens share too much information about their names, dates of birth and locations.\n\nTherefore, it's very important to make sure teens are safe when they use social networks. \n\n Many of the same rules that work for online chat work for these sites:\n\n\u203bDon't use your real name.\n\n\u203b Don't give out personal information to people you don't know. A last name and a town\n\nare enough for a bad guy to find where you are. \n\n\u203b Don't believe that people are who they say to be. \n\n\u203b Immediately end any communication that makes you uncomfortable and report it to a\n\n parent.\n\nOnly if you are sure of your safety, can you enjoy the fun brought by social networking. Besides, trying to deal with all problems on your own can lead to terrible results.

When you are in trouble at school, your friends will help you; when you study hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of your life and your health; when you get success, your friends will say congratulations to you; when you do something wrong, people around you will help you to correct it. And when you do something good to others, you will feel happy, too. All these are your happiness. If you notice a bit of them, you can see that happiness is always around you.\n\n Happiness is not the same as money. It is a feeling of your heart. When you are poor, you can also say you are very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have more chances to challenge(\u5411\u2026\u6311\u6218)yourself. So you can not always say you are poor and you have bad luck. As the saying goes, life is like a revolving(\u65cb\u8f6c)door. When it closes, it also opens.

Many agreed that climate change may be one of the greatest threats (\u5a01\u80c1) facing the planet.

Yes! There are several little things you can do to make a difference. Try carpooling. This will help reduce the amount of fossil fuels going into the atmosphere. Whenever you use electricity, you help put greenhouse gases into the air. Turn off lights, the television, and the computer when you are through with them.

A good scent (\u6c14\u4f53),like flowers, brings you pleasure. A bad scent, like smoke or sour milk, warns you of danger. Most things around you release scent particles (\u5fae\u7c92) into the air. These invisible chemicals enter the nose when you breathe. Nerves in the nose send information to the brain to identify a smell. You are able to recognize thousands of smells.\n\nBreathing\n\nMost of the air you breathe enters through your nose. The nose uses hair and mucus (\u7c98\u6db2) to clean dust and germs (\u7ec6\u83cc) out of the air. The air that enters your nose contains oxygen. Your body uses oxygen to unlock the energy in the food you eat.\u00a0 Even when you sleep, your body needs energy to keep your heart beating and your brain working.\n\nTasting\n\nYour nose helps you enjoy food. Flavor is a mixture of taste and smell. The smell of the food helps you identify what you are eating. The sense of smell contributes more to (\u8d21\u732e) food flavor than the sense of taste .When you are sick and have a stuffy nose, your food doesn't taste as good because without smell, food loses most of its flavor.\n\nSmell memory\n\nSmells can bring back memories. Your brain uses a process to create a picture in your mind from the odors(\u6c14\u5473)you smell. Smells can affect your feelings because the part of the brain that helps you identify smells is close to the area that affects your emotions, mood and memory. More smell memories are collected as you get older.\n\nYour nose has many important jobs, and is more than just a smeller!\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:How many important jobs does a nose do according to the passage?

Sally says finding friendship is just like planting a tree. You plant the seed and take care of it to make it grow.\n\n First, you should choose a friend. What makes a Good friend? It is not because a person has money or good looks. A good friend should be kind and patient. For example, if you have a bad day, a good friend should listen to your complaints and do his or her best to help. To make a friend, you can not be too shy. You should make each other happy and share your lives. But things cannot always be happy. Even the best have fights. What should you do when you have a fight with your friend? You have to talk to him or her. When there is no one around, have an honest talk. If he or she doesn't want to talk, you could write a letter.\n\n There are three steps to being friends again:\n\n Tell him or her how you are feeling ; say what your friend has done wrong, and explain why you did this or that. Remember that friendship is the most important thing in your life.\n\n(\u00a0\u00a0 ) 1.

Drink water at the right time.\n\n1) After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren't drinking for the whole night.

That's according to researchers at Duke University, US.\n\nDuring an experiment on 1,000 people, scientists assessed (\u8bc4\u5b9a) their personalities in two ways: by asking someone they knew, such as a family member or friend; then by asking someone they had just met, such as a nurse. The study found that those who were careful at age 26 were in better health after 12 years.\uf076\n\nBeing careful means that people tend to have a lot of self-control, and are less likely to smoke, the scientists said. Careful people are also more likely to have an active lifestyle and healthy diet.\n\nFrom those who were least careful, 45 percent developed health problems by the age of 38. Such health issues included gum disease and high blood pressure (\u9ad8\u8840\u538b). To compare, only 18 percent of careful people went on to develop health problems.\n\nAnother positive personality was called \u201copenness to experience\u201d, meaning curious and imaginative. People who have more of this personality have higher IQ scores. So they'd be more likely to know how to find medical help to prevent disease.\n\nAccording to the report, if doctors assessed our personalities, it could help doctors to find which young adults need advice on how to live a healthy lifestyle. What's surprising is that stress didn't play a big part on a person's health.

Scientists have found that dogs are the only animals that can read emotion(\u60c5\u611f)in faces much like humans. The finding suggests that like an understanding friend, dogs can see if we are happy, sad, pleased or angry.\n\nWhen humans look at a new face, their eyes usually look across the left, falling on the right hand side of the person's face first. A possible reason for this is that the right side of the human face is better at expressing emotions.\n\nScientists have now shown that pet dogs also have \u201cleft gaze bias(\u5de6\u89c6\u504f\u597d)\u201d, but only when looking at human faces. No other animal has been known to do like this before. Dr. Kun Guo showed 17 dogs pictures of human, dog and monkey faces as well as something else with his team. The dogs' eyes and heads show a strong left gaze bias when the animals see human faces. But this did not happen when they were shown other pictures, including those of dogs.\n\nGuo suggests that over thousands of years living with humans, dogs may have developed the left gaze bias as a way to guess our emotions.\n\n\u201cRecent studies show that the right side of our faces can express emotions better than the left.

It looks like a mobile phone. You can hold it in your hand, or put in your pocket. It is sometimes put into a watch or a telephone. We also find a GPS in cars, planes, or boats. Some of them have electronic maps, so you know where you are. For example, in a city they can tell you the name of the street.\n\n There are three parts to GPS. The first part is the receiver. You can hold it in your hand, or have it fixed into your car, plane, etc. The second part is a group of satellites going around the Earth. The receiver communicates with at least four of the satellites and calculates its position.

But do we really eat only when we are hungry? No, we sometimes eat even when we're not hungry, and this causes overeating ----eating too much. But overeating can do a lot of harm , as it can cause obesity\uff08\u80a5\u80d6\uff09that can cause heart problems and other illnesses.\n\nThere are many common reasons that make us eat too much.\n\nMeeting friends may be good for our social life, but it can also be one of the main reasons for overeating. We usually pay no attention to our health when we meet with friends.\n\nMoods such as anger, sadness, happiness ,fear are the most common ones that make us eat food to help us feel better .\n\nBusy lifestyles can have an effect on our eating habits .We start eating too quickly just to save time , as a result ,we eat more than our body's requirement . When we eat meals or snacks too fast, our brain takes some time to realize that it's full, and of course it results in overeating.\n\nTemperature plays a very important role in deciding our food habitat In winters, we usually have warm or hot drinks like coffee, tea, hot chocolate and heavy meals to keep ourselves warm . In summers , we have ice dreams ,desserts and other drinks .These foods with the regular food add to calorie and lead to overeating .\n\nSupermarkets have lots of attractive offers to get us to buy things that we may or may not need .There is no doubt we love eating and when we are served with our favourite food , we act like we have never seen food before .\n\nWe have always been taught to finish everything that is on the plate .So, even when we start feeling full , we keep on eating till our plate is empty or till we stop feeling guilty about wasting food .\n\nHow to control how much you put in your stomach ? here are some ways .\n\nUse smaller plates and tall, skinny glasses. It seems that there is more food on the plate and more to drink in the glass. Smaller serving containers\uff08\u5bb9\u5668\uff09help stop you from putting much food and drink .\n\nMake the sweets and other snacks out of reach . Get the candy dish off your desk and set out a bowl of fruit instead .\n\nDon't overeat\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:Harm / Result / Problem / Effect / Influence\n\u5c0f\u98982:causes\n\u5c0f\u98983:without\n\u5c0f\u98984:suffer\n\u5c0f\u98985:affect / influence\n\u5c0f\u98986:seasons\n\u5c0f\u98987:favourite\n\u5c0f\u98988:stop\n\u5c0f\u98989:Ways / How\n\u5c0f\u989810:larger / bigger / large / big\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/61csc303315737.html"},

It is only when we can not see perfectly that we come to see how important our eyes are.\n\nPeople who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly.\n\nPeople who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book unless they hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too.\n\nOther people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts. Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them.\n\nWhen night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you, which seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they can not see it any more, and they believe they were mistaken. However, this mistake happens because the center of the eye, which is very sensitive in daylight, is not as sensitive as the sides of the eye after dark.\n\nWe don't know that our eyes are of great importance until \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\nAccording to the passage, a \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is more likely to be nearsighted.\n\nPeople who are farsighted \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ .\n\nTo see a small thing at night, it is better to look \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ .\n\n", "answer": "", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/dgngc303302875.html"},

The Lab is a place where students can do all kinds of experiments and test their ideas. Kids can work in groups in the same projects in The Camp Fire. The Show Off is where kids can show their inventions. And if the kids need a rest, they can visit The Watering Hole, which has all kinds of fun activities.\n\nSounds great?

The simple answer is: \u201cyou can't\u201d Look around you, everything you see is the result of someone trying new things.\n\n Another good thing about mistakes is this: when you are making mistakes, you are learning. For example, Edison failed 10,000 times before he invented the light bulb. When he was asked how he felt to fail that many times, he said that he hadn't failed 10,000 times, but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work.\n\n Finally, when you make a mistake, you are much closer to success. Why? Because you have said what you should say, and you have done what you should do. Every time you make a mistake, you are closer to success. But it doesn't mean that you can make mistakes without thinking. Instead, when you try new things you have to think them over, so that you can keep away from some unnecessary mistakes. We shouldn't spend all our time and money on the only one way, but use them correctly, because our time and money are limited(\u6709\u9650\u7684)\n\n There is an old saying, \u201cif you are not making mistakes, you are not trying hard enough.\u201d So go bravely and make mistakes.

China and twelve other countries joined it. \n\nHowever, it's not enough. Remember that nature is a food chain (\u94fe). If we hurt and kill too many wild deer and pigs, wild tigers will die out because of hunger (\u9965\u997f). So the most important thing is to save the animals that tigers eat.

If the body is not used, it will become weak. Exercise keeps it strong. \n\nExercise helps the blood (\u8840\u6db2) to move around inside the body. Blood takes nutrition (\u8425\u517b) to all parts of our bodies. The brains (\u5927\u8111) in our heads also need blood. We think with our brains.

Well, this saying means that you dislike him or her so much that you don't want to touch or go near him or her, even within ten feet!\n\nYou don't have a leg to stand on.\n\n This saying doesn't mean that the person you're talking to has no legs. It means that his or her argument is incorrect. He or she doesn't have a leg to stand on because he or she has no facts to support what he or she is saying. This saying is a good way to tell people that you think they're wrong.\n\n Break a leg!\n\n This saying actually means the opposite of what it sounds like.

But have you heard of typhoons?\n\nTyphoons are some of the worst storms, usually around the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. Most happen in July, August and September.\n\nHow does a typhoon happen? When lots of sea water gets hot in the summer sun, it evaporates \uff08\u84b8\u53d1\uff09into the air. This makes the air hotter. When the air gets warm enough, it starts to move higher up into sky. Then cooler air around it rushes in. It fills the space that is left. After the air gets warmer, it starts to move quickly, making wind. The wind goes in circles\uff08\u5706\u5708\uff09and it keeps moving higher in the sky. The warmer the air gets, the quicker the wind moves. And when the wind moves faster than 30 metres a second, a typhoon begins.\n\nA typhoon has two parts, one is called the \u201ceye\u201d. In the eye, the wind does not move so fast. The other part is the wall of clouds around the eye. Here are the strongest winds and hardest rains.\n\nTyphoons are very dangerous. In November this year, Typhoon Haiyan killed 5500 people in Philippines. More people are missing.\n\n What to do when a typhoon hits?\n\nStay inside. Close all the windows and stay away from them.\n\nTry to bring all of your things inside.

Some people use less energy by sharing a car. For example, four people can ride together in one car instead of driving four cars to work. Whenever we use electricity, we put greenhouse gases into the air.

Some products, like certain cars, are made specially to save energy. These cars can travel longer on less gasoline (\u6c7d\u6cb9). They don't pollute as much, either. Products like computers, TVs and VCRs with the ENERGY STAR label (\u6807\u7b7e) are made to save energy. Buying products with these labels will help protect the environment. \n\n Buy recyclable (\u53ef\u5faa\u73af\u518d\u7528\u7684) products instead of non-recyclable ones.

With any relationship, you need to let other person know how you are feeling. If you are not able to communicate, you \n\n.When you are mad at your parents, or anyone else, not talking to them doesn't solve anything.\n\n\u3000\u3000Communication begins with the concerns (\u5173\u5fc3) of another. It means that you can't just come home from school, go up to your room and take no notice to anyone. Even if you just say \u201cHi\u201d, and see how their day was for five minutes, it is better than nothing.\n\n\u3000\u3000If you looked up the word \u201ccommunication\u201d in a dictionary, it would say \u201cthe exchange of ideas, the conveyance \uff08\u8868\u8fbe\uff09of information, correspondence \uff08\u901a\u4fe1\uff09, means of communication: a letter or a message\u201d. To keep a good relationship, you must keep communication strong. Let people know how you feel, even if it's just by writing a note.\n\n\u3000\u3000When dealing with parents, you always have to make them feel good about how they are doing as a parent. If you are trying to make them see something as you see it, tell them that you'll listen to what they have to say, and ask them politely to listen to you. Shouting or walking away only makes the situation worse.\n\n\u3000\u3000Here is an example: one night, Sophie went to a street party with her friends. She knew she had to be home by midnight after the fireworks, but she didn't feel she could just ask to go home. That would be rude. After all, they had been nice enough to take her along with them. Needless to say, she was late getting home. Her parents were mad at first, but when Sophie explained why she was late, they weren't as mad and let it go. Communication is the key here. If Sophie's parents had not been willing to listen, Sophie would have been in a lot of trouble.\n\n\u3000\u3000Communication isn't a one-way matter: it goes both ways. Just remember: if you get into a situation like Sophie's, telling the other person how you feel-------listening is the key to communication.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:In the writer's view, dealing with parents is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ than with children.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The underlined phrase \u201c drift apart\u201d in Paragraph 2 means \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The example in Paragraph 6 shows that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:All the following statements are correct except \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/23fsc303300580.html"},

DNA is something that everybody has, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our mother and father, because we get some of their DNA to make our own.\n\n  People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Gregor Mendel discovered a special reason why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things named \u201cgenes\u201d in our body. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick made another discovery and found out that those small parts are real messages written in the DNA with a special language.\n\n\u3000\u3000In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg and Johann Matthaei found a message in DNA showing how DNA tells the cell (\u7ec6\u80de) to build its parts. Scientists have now found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \u201cword\u201d means, we can help save more people from several illnesses.\n\n\u3000\u3000Most people hope that this will help make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when people begin to know more words and find out lots of other information, we might use it in a wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people from getting jobs.

Our lives are full of them, from the small ones to the life-changing. The right to choose is \n\n to everyone. Yet sometimes we make bad decisions that leave us unhappy or full of regret. Can science help?\n\nMost of us know little about the mental processes that lie behind our decisions. Luckily, what psychologists(\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6)are finding may help us all make better choices. Here are some of their amazing discoveries to help you make up your mind.\n\nConsider your emotions. You might think that emotions are the enemy of decision making, but in fact they are a part of it. Whenever you make up your mind, your brain's emotional centre is active. University of Southern California scientist, Antonio Damasia, has studied people with damage to only the emotional parts of their brains , and found that they were unable to make basic choices about what to wear or eat. Damasia thinks this may be because our brains store emotional memories of past choice, which we use to help the present decision-making.\n\nHowever, making choices under the influence of an emotion can greatly affect the result. Take anger, for example. A study by Nitika Garg of the University of Mississippi and other scientists found the angry shoppers were more likely to choose the first thing they were offered rather than considering other choices. It seems that anger can lead us to make quick decisions without much thinking.\n\nAll emotions affect our thinking and motivation\uff08\u52a8\u673a\uff09\uff0cso it may be best to avoid making important decisions under their influence.

Like a planet, a comet has no light of its own. It shines from the sunlight it reflects (\u53cd\u5c04). Like the earth, a comet goes round the sun, but on a much longer path (\u8f68\u9053) than the earth travels.\n\n If a comet isn't a star, what is it then?\n\n\u3000\u00a0\u00a0 Some scientists think that a large part of a comet is water frozen into pieces of ice and mixed with iron and rock dust and perhaps a few big pieces of rock. When sunshine melts (\u878d\u5316) the ice in the comet, great clouds of gas go trailing after it. These clouds, together with the dust, form a long tail.Many people perhaps have seen a comet. However no one knows how many comets there are. There may be millions of comets, but only a few come close enough for us to see.\n\n\u3000\u3000An Englishman named Edmund Halley, who lived from 1656 to 1742, found out a lot about the paths that comets take through the sky. Some comets move out of our sight and never come back. Others keep coming back at regular times. A big comet that keeps coming back was named after Halley because he was the one who worked out when it would come back again. Maybe you have ever seen Halley's Comets because the last time it came close to the sun and the earth was in the year 1986. Then people all over the world were outside at night to look at it.

We're going to leave soon. The entire ride will take about five hours, so sit back and enjoy the trip. As we rise, be sure to look out the window. You'll see the sky change from deep blue to black. It is one of the most wonderful views\uff08\u666f\u8272\uff09you will ever see! \u201d\n\nDoes this sound like the Sci-Fi Channel? Well, it's not. Scientists are thinking that a \u201cspace elevator\u201d will be possible toward the end of the 21st century. A space elevator will consist of a long cable (\u7535\u7f06) from the Earth's surface into space to an altitude(\u9ad8\u5ea6) of about 35,786 km. \u201cElevators\u201d will travel along the cable and move people and loads between Earth and space. One of the greatest advantages is that the cost will be much less. Researchers estimate (\u4f30\u8ba1) that a passenger with baggage at 150 kg might cost only \\\\$222! Compare that to today's cost of around \\\\$3.3 million for the same weight. It would make \u201ccheap\u201d space travel possible. Scientists believe carbon nanotubes (\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1) may be used to make high-strength materials for the cables, although they are still being studied.\n\nIt was Arthur C. Clarke who brought this idea to the general public. In his science fiction novel Fountains of Paradise, engineers build a space elevator on top of a mountain peak on an island. One day, Clarke was asked a question by a student during his speech. The student asked when the space elevator would become a reality. Clarke answered, \u201cProbably about 50 years after everybody stops laughing.\u201d He's got a point.

It also notes a large increase in the number of international students from China.\n\nThese findings are from the latest Open Doors Report. The report documents the record number of international students in the United States during 2012, 2013 school year. It says more than seven hundred sixty-four thousand four-hundred such students were attending American colleges and universities during the last two years. That represents an increase of almost six percent than one year earlier.\n\nOn the other hand, the number of Americans studying overseas (\u6d77\u5916) increased by one percent, which reached nineteen thousand this year.\n\nThe report says one hundred ninety-four thousand students at American colleges and universities were from \n\nChina. That is an increase of more than twenty-three percent over the year before. Peggy Blumenthal, an expert(\u4e13\u5bb6) of international education, described the effect of the increase in Chinese students.\n\n\"Now they have been coming for some time. But this year was the highest level ever.\" She says many Chinese families are able to pay for the highest-quality education for their children. The children mainly choose to study in America.\n\n\"We know many of them have enough income to be able to afford to send them anywhere in the world that they want to go. And for the most part, looking around the world, Chinese students still prefer to come to the United States as their choice.\"\n\nChinese students are not the only ones who want to attend American colleges and universities. After China, India sends the second largest number of students to the United States for higher education. India has about one hundred thousand students in American schools. South Korea is third with about seventy two thousand students.\n\nWhy do so many foreign students study in the United States? Peggy Blumenthal provides one reason.\n\n\"The advantage America has is that we have a huge system and a very perfect system. So there are over four thousand universities and colleges in the United States. Among them are some top ones in the world, and what that tells us is there is still a lot of room to host international students.\"\n\nForeign students represent less than four percent of the total student population in American higher education.

Practising, breathing exercises and thinking make you healthier in body, mind and spirit.\n\n For many people, that's enough of an answer, but there's more if you are interested.\n\n Yoga began in India about 5,000 years ago. At that time, people wanted to be free, healthy and live a long life, so this kind of exercise was born. The early yoga was part of a religion (\u5b97\u6559). It was usually taught one to one\u2014one teacher with one student. Yoga is an Indian word that means \u201cto join together\u201d. There are three parts of yoga altogether: exercise, breathing and meditation (\u6c89\u601d). In the past, people paid more attention to the spirit.

It's also very cold and dark. With me is Jim Nightingale, and he is the reason I'm up so early. He passes me a hot cup of coffee. \"Not long to wait now,\" he says. I hope he's right.\n\n After a few minutes there is a very weak light in the east, and then I hear a bird singing. It sings very loud and very clear. \"That's the robin(\u77e5\u66f4\u9e1f),\" says Jim. A few more birds start singing with the robin and Jim knows the names of them too. Half an hour later, there are more and more birds singing, and it's very loud! Suddenly, all around us the air is full of the sound of birdsong. This is the dawn chorus(\u6668\u9e23), and it's beautiful.\n\n \"Wow, this is amazing!\" I tell Jim, who is smiling. \"Is there a dawn chorus every morning?\"\n\n \"Birds can sing any time of the year but the best time is the end of winter and during the spring. This is when the birds sing most.\"\n\n \"Really? So, why do they sing?\" I ask.\n\n \"Well, there are two reasons,\" explains Jim. \"Most of the songbirds who sing are males. They want to find a female(\u96cc\u6027)so they sing to show how strong they are. The females listen and choose the best singer! The birds also sing to tell other males to go away. They need their own area; they don't like sharing with another male.\"\n\n I listen to the birds; the songs seem too much to me. \"Do the birds sing a special song in the morning?\"\n\n\"That's a good question,\" replied Jim. \"The successful birds have many kinds of calls and songs. Sometimes they copy the songs of other birds. This makes it sound like there are many birds in that place already and other males stay away. Also the female likes songs with different notes. Some birds, for example the European wren, have songs that contain over 700 different notes per minute!\" \n\nSo, how does Jim know so much about birds? Well, he works as a volunteer for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. He is trying to help the birds live in the modern world. \"More and more of the birds' habitat disappears every year. The sparrow, for example, was a very common bird in the UK, now it's in danger.\"\n\n By now the sun is up and the birds are quiet.

Often the city dump is placed where the ground is low or there is a big hole. The kitchen rubbish is broken into small pieces and sent into the sewage system. The sewage system takes away the used water from toilets, bathtubs and other places.\n\n To keep mice and flies away, some earth is used to cover the newly dumped rubbish. Later, grass may be planted on the rubbish-filled land. Finally, a house or a school may be built there, and then you'd never know that this had once been an old rubbish dump.\n\n In other cities the rubbish is burnt in special places.

If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language.

Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face.

Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted(\u9762\u76ee\u5168\u975e\u7684).\n\n Everyone should just relax, say linguists(\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6)\uff0eThey believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says. \"Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.\"\n\n Linguist James Milroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can \n\n that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become \"corrupted\"; they simply change to meet the new needs.\n\n However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\"\n\n Perhaps, we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, \"I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Text is just for fun.\"\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the main purpose of the first paragraph?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which of the following is true according to the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983: The expression \"bet your bottom dollar\" in paragrap5 means\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What can be the best title for the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/t79lc303298900.html"},

But sometimes it does not seem like the same language. In fact, there are some important differences between British English and American English.\n\n First of all, they sound very different. Often, Americans don't say each word separately. They say several words together. Americans may say \u201cI dunno\u201d instead of \u201cI don't know\u201d. Or they may say \u201cWhaddya say?\u201d instead of \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d however, the British are more careful in their speech. They usually say all the words and keep them \n\n.\n\n Words sometimes have different meanings too. Some American words are never used in England. The same thing is true of some British words in America. For example, the vocabulary\uff08\u8bcd\u6c47\uff09for cars and driving is very different. Americans drive trucks, but in England people drive lorries.\n\n Many expressions are also different in the two countries. In England, if you are going to telephone your friends, you \u201cphone them up\u201d. In America, you \u201cgive them a call\u201d.\n\n There're also some differences in grammar. For example, when Americans ask a question., they say \u201cDo you have a storybook?\u201d But the British often say \u201cHave you a storybook?\u201d\n\n All these differences can be confusing \uff08\u6613\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\uff09if you are learning English. But most languages are like this. Languages change over time. When people live in separate places, the languages change in different ways. This is what has happened to English. It can also happen to other languages, such as French. Many people in Canada speak French but their French is very different from the French of France.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What does the word \u201cseparate\u201d mean in the passage?

The people were poor but they were happy. After all, their forefathers had lived in the same way for centuries.\n\nThen one day, some visitors from the city arrived. They told the villagers there were some people elsewhere who liked to eat frog. However, they did not have enough frogs of their own, and so they wanted to buy frogs from other places.\n\nThis seemed like money for nothing. There were millions of frogs in the fields around, and they were useless to the villagers. What they had to do was to catch them. Agreement was reached, and the children were sent into the fields to catch frogs. Every week a truck arrived to collect the catch and hand over the money. The villagers were able to dream of a better future. But the dream didn't last long.\n\nThe change was hardly noticed at first, but it seemed as if the crops weren't doing so well. More worry was that the children fell ill more often, and there were more insects around lately. The villagers decided that they couldn't just wait to see the crops failing and the children getting weak. They would have to use the money earned to buy pesticides (\u6740\u5242) and medicine. Soon there was no money left.\n\nThe people realized what was happening. It was the frog. They hadn't been useless. They had been doing an important job--- eating insects. Now with so many frogs killed, the insects were increasing more rapidly. They were damaging the crops and spreading diseases.\n\nNow, the people are still poor.

More than 700 Milu deer live freely there. There are not many red-Crowned cranes in the world, but every winter you can see some in the red-Crowned Nature Reserve in the Yellow Sea Wetlands. \n\nThe temperature in the wetlands is usually neither too high nor too low. There is a lot of rain and sunshine, too. They are really good places for wildlife (\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269). Offering food and home for some special kinds of animals and birds is not the only reason why we need to protect wetlands. Wetlands are important because they also prevent flood. But some people want to change the wetlands to make more space for farms and buildings. This means there will be less and less space for wildlife. \n\nLuckily, more and more people are beginning to realize the importance of wetlands and wildlife.

The greenhouse effect is important.\u00a0 Without it, the Earth would not be warm enough for us to live on. But just a little warmer than it is now could cause problems for humans, plants and animals.\n\nMany of the things we do every day can change the Earth's temperature by sending greenhouse gases into the air. We send greenhouse gases into the air when we watch TV, turn on lights, dry hair, play video games, wash or dry our clothes or drive cars. The rubbish from factories and homes also produces greenhouse gases.\n\n Even a small change in temperature can affect our weather. This can cause changes in the sea levels, the air, flooding, and our fresh water.\n\nThe change in the temperature can also cause changes in the living places for animals and plants, endangering many animals.\n\n Global warming is a big problem, and every little bit we do can help. We can save electricity. We can save energy in other ways such as by taking buses or walking rather than driving cars.

Around twenty percent of children suffer from stomachaches that doctors cannot find a reason for.\n\nThis new research is especially good for kids with active imaginations. Researchers found that the more creative the child is, the better he or she is at imagining the pain away.\n\nThe researchers used a relaxing CD with children. A voice guided them through different fantasy(\u5e7b\u60f3) situations. One of these was pretending to be floating on a cloud. Thirty children took part in the tests. Half of them used the \u201cguided imagery\u201d method, and the other half received normal medicines. Researchers found 73.3 percent of the CD users reported a reduction in pain. This compared to only 26.7 percent of kids who got normal treatment.\n\nStudy leader Dr Miranda Tilburg was very excited about her findings. She believed that it was a very cheap and easy way to stop children's stomachaches.

But even though they are all different, they have one thing in common: they all need each other in order to live on.\n\n The trees feed the forest \"people\" by making food in their leaves; by using sunlight to join water and minerals from the soil and air. Their deep network of roots joins the soil together and stops it from dying out, making it possible for living things to live in it.\n\n Human beings are like the living things in the forest. We need one another in order to live. We need the farmers to grow our food, railroad and truck drivers to bring it to our shops and clerks (\u552e\u5458)to sell it to us. We need people to prepare our food and cook it and others to take our waste things away. Then, of course, we need doctors, nurses, government leaders, mailmen, telephone operators, and many others.\n\n We also need other human beings in another way. We need people for friendship, to talk over our problems, exchange ideas. Think how lonely and unhappy you would be if you lived all alone.\n\n Life is a matter of giving and taking.

Reduce(\u51cf\u5c11)\n\nIf you want to reduce waste, you should use things wisely. A large number of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses a little paper carelessly and throw it out, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the waste.\n\n 2. Reuse\uff08\u518d\u5229\u7528\uff09\n\n You should always think of reusing the usable things before throwing them out. Give your clothes you do not use or the ones which are too small to the poor. In a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters.\n\n 3. Recycle\uff08\u56de\u6536\uff09\n\n Bottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed(\u6253\u788e) flat and melted(\u878d\u5316) and the metal things are made for new coke cans.\n\n 4. Recover \uff08\u6062\u590d\uff09\n\n When you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten apples, you have two choices: one is to throw the whole apples away, or you could cut off the rotten parts and use the good parts. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food.\n\n 5. Repair\uff08\u4fee\u8865\uff09\n\n If one of the legs of your table is broken, you can repair it. If you want to change for better ones, it is better for you to sell the old things or give them to other people who can use them after doing some repair.

Note landmarks on the route as you go away from your bike. When you return, go back along the same route.\n\n The simple way of finding your direction is by using lines such as streets in a town, streams, or walls in the countryside to guide you.

The most famous recent one was made by Google in 2009. There are cameras and radars (\u96f7\u8fbe) on the top of the car. They allow the computer in the car to draw a 3D map of the environment.

For example, a little English girl called Sally Jones is two years old and quite ordinary (\u666e\u901a\u7684). But when she was younger, she never went to sleep at night. She never got tired. Her parents were very worried. Finally, Sally's parents took her to a special doctor.\n\nThe doctor said that she must never eat food with additives in it. He was sure that the additives had a very bad effect on her body, and made her too active. He was quite correct. As soon as Sally started to eat foods with no additives, she began to sleep well at night.\n\nNow she is the same as other little girls, except that she can't eat many foods that other children love, such as ice-creams, because they have additives in them.\n\n\u6839\u636e\u77ed\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u56de\u7b54\u4e0b\u5217\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What's the Chinese meaning of the word \u201cadditive\u201d?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What are the functions (\u529f\u80fd) of the additives?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Did Sally like sleeping at night before she went to see the doctor?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What happened to Sally when she stopped eating the foods with additives?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Why can't Sally eat ice-creams?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:\uff08\u98df\u54c1\uff09\u6dfb\u52a0\u5242 \u3002\n\u5c0f\u98982:They are put into foods to give them color and taste, to stop them going bad and so on. \n\u5c0f\u98983:No\uff0cshe didn\u2019t.\n\u5c0f\u98984:As soon as Sally started to eat foods with no additives, she began to sleep well at night. \n\u5c0f\u98985:because there are additives in it.\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/2owkc303296885.html"},

They are all left-handed. Today about 15% of the people are left-handed. But why are people left-handed? The answer is the way the brain (\u5927\u8111) works. The brain has two halves---the right half and the left half. The right half controls (\u63a7\u5236) the left side of the body, and the left half controls the right side of the body. So right-handed people have a strong left brain, and the left \u2013handed people have a strong right brain.\n\n The two halves of the brain are about the same size. But each side controls different things. The left side controls language, Maths and logic (\u903b\u8f91). When you remember new words, or when you put things in order, you use your left side.\n\n The right side of the brain controls colour and music. It is also good at recognizing (\u8ba4\u51fa) faces. This does not mean that all artists are left-handed and all accountants (\u4f1a\u8ba1\u5e08) are right-handed.

You are probably better at some school subjects than others. These may show strengths that you can use in your work. A boy who is good at mathematics can use that in an engineering career. A girl who spells well and likes English may be good at office work. So it is important to know the subjects you do well in at school. On the other hand, you may not have any specially strong subjects but your records show a general satisfactory standard. Although not all subjects can be used directly in a job, they may have indirect value. A knowledge of history is not required for most jobs but if history is one of your good subjects you will have learned to remember facts and details. This is an ability that can be useful in many jobs.\n\n\u3000\u3000Your school may have taught you skills, such as typing or technical drawing, which you can use in your work. You may be good at metalwork or cookery and look for a job where you can improve these skills. If you have had a part-time job on Saturdays or in the summer, think what you gained from it. If nothing else, you may have learned how to get to work on time, to follow instructions and to get on with older workers. You may have learned to give correct change in a shop, for example. Just as important, you may become interested in a particular industry or career you see from the inside in a part-time job.\n\n\u3000\u3000Facing your weak points is also part of knowing yourself. You may be all thumbs when you handle tools; perhaps you are a poor speller or cannot add up a column of figures. It is better to face any weakness than to pretend they do not exist. Your school record, for instance, may not be too good, yet it is an important part of your background.

You must read such things slowly to remember each important step and understand each important idea.\n\n3.Some things should be read rapidly throughout.

However, there is another difference between humans and computers. Computers don't forget information they are given, but humans often do. No one remembers everything, and luckily we don't usually have to. But everyone can improve their memory if they want to. Here are some suggestions.\n\n\u25c6Try to use new informati6n immediately. For example, if you meet someone who says \"Hi! I'm Carlos,\" don't just say \"Hello.\" Repeat the person's name. Say\"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"\n\n\u25c6Break a big number into smaller parts. For example, it's hard to memorize (\u8bb0\u5fc6) 109244153. But if you break it into three parts--109/244/153\u2014it becomes easier.\n\n\u25c6Write out what you need to remember ever and over again. This will help you keep it in mind longer, especially for memorizing formulas (\u516c\u5f0f) or facts.\n\n\u25c6Always review information. If you bring what you've learned back to your mind, they become easier to remember. For example, before you go to sleep, it's a good idea to review the new things you learned that clay.\n\n\u25c6Discuss with a friend. It is always easier to remember things through discussions. You can have a discussion about what's right and what's wrong, and it will lead to the right answer.\n\n\u25c6Never tell yourself that you have a bad memory. You can always do something to help improve your memory. And everyone's memory gets better if they use it often enough.\n\nAll of the suggestions are helpful.

You may have a favourite food, but you'd better eat something different. If you eat different foods, you will probably get more nutrients your body needs.\n\nSecond, drink water and milk as often as possible. When you're really thirsty, cool water is the No. 1 choice. Milk is a great drink that can give you more calcium your body needs to grow strong bones.\n\nThird, listen to your body. How do you feel when you are full? When you are eating, notice how your body feels and when your stomach feels comfortably full. Eating too much will not make you feel comfortable and make you fat.\n\nFourth, limit screen time. Screen time is the time you watch TV, DVDS and videos, or using computers. It is good to take more exercise such as basketball, bike riding and swimming. You can't watch TV for more than two hours a day.\n\nFifth, be active. One thing you'd like to do as a kid is to find out which activity you like best.

When the air gets warm enough, \n\n It fills the space that is left. After the air gets warmer, it starts to move quickly, making wind.

The other part is the wall of clouds around the eye. This is where the strongest with and hardest rains are.\n\nTyphoons are very dangerous. In 2004, Typhoon Yunna killed 164 people in Zhejiang, and 24 people were missing.

Maybe not. New research into the reasons for shark attacks (\u653b\u51fb) suggests that sharks don't like the way humans taste! In fact, most people who are attacked by the shark are still alive after receiving only one bite (\u54ac). Why is this?\n\n There are many opinions to explain why sharks sometimes attack people. One opinion is that sharks are just curious (\u597d\u5947\u7684). We know that sharks are the strongest animals in their environment, so they are not afraid of anything. Naturally, that means they are curious when they meet something unusual. Because they don't have hands or feet., the only way they can find out an object is to bite it! It is thought that sharks sometimes bite humans for this reason, and then swim away.\n\n Scientists also say that sharks would not waste energy trying to eat a human, as we have a lot of bones (\u9aa8\u5934). It is hard for a shark to eat us because sharks don't have hands, and they can't pull the meat off our bones. Maybe that's why they only bite us once. Unluckily, one bite from a large shark is serious enough to hurt people greatly!\n\n Another opinion is that sharks attack humans by mistake. Some sharks may sometimes mistake humans for a seal. An example of this is when a shark attack attacks a surfer. A surfer lying on a surfboard looks like a seal when seen from below. Sharks like seals because they have thick fat.\n\n Whatever the reason for shark attacks on humans, sharks should be afraid of us.

My 12-year-old daughter is in tears.\"I have so take a test tomorrow. I don't understand any of it,\" she cries out. After shouting and shutting her door, she calms down enough to go through her notes. The following dry I ask her how the test went and the just says \"OK,I got a nine\".\n\n\"Wow. well done!\" I say, before she finishes with \"But I never get a ten!\"\n\nAccording to James, this \n\n with getting top marks has been a bad development, which encourages people to think of education in terms of work and money. To test this, I asked my daughter why she was so worried about her tests. She looked at me as if I was thick. \"Well, if I don't get good grades, I won't be able to afford nice things like a car and stuff.\"\n\nI was quite surprised, because I don't consider myself a pushy parent. But James suggests and it leaves students feeling failures even if they are very bright. He points to the Danish system\uff08\u4f53\u5236\uff09of education as a better model. Creating happy citizens who have good social skills is seen as more important than high achievements at school or the needs of business.\n\nFor me, I cannot remember the last time I had to work out the area of a circle, recite a Shakespeare poem or grammar rules, yet I have lived a happy life. What I really needed to learn at school was how to make polite conversations, or how to avoid getting into debt or how to develop good personality.\n\nThis is in fact similar to what Oliver James really has in mind. And he is looking for schools where students are encouraged to find and follow their own interests, something more like Tongjon. Tongjon has been developed in some Korean private schools. It is quite different from the more rigid system of learning things by heart that is used in Korea, and indeed in many other school systems around the world.\n\nAs the Russian poet Pushkin said,\" Inspiration(\u7075\u611f\uff09is needed in geometry(\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\uff09just as much as in poetry \",and inspiration does not come from endlessly revising for tests or getting worried about them .\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What does the writer probably think of his/her daughter?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What does the word \"\n\n\"in paragraph 3 mean?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What can we infer from the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The writer wants to tell us that\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/nj08c203294614.html"},

It looked as if it might rain, so Mike carried his umbrella. Suddenly a big storm blew in, bending the trees. The noise of the wind sounded like the barking of Mike's dog Toby. Toby really hated storms and barked whenever he wanted to be let inside. Then Mike realized that it wasn't the sound of the wind. It was Toby. The dog was running after him down the busy street, barking. The sound was filled with blame. Mike felt guilty because he had left Toby outside.

You need to wash your hands with soap and hot water before you eat, after you use the toilet, and after you touch animals, because your hands may carry viruses. \n\nCover your nose and mouth. When someone sneezes(\u6253\u55b7\u568f) or coughs, flu viruses can travel as far as one meter through the air, so you'd better stand a proper distance (\u8ddd\u79bb) while talking to someone who has a cold. And always cover your mouth and nose with a piece of paper when you sneeze or cough, and then clean your hands.\n\nWear a mask(\u53e3\u7f69). Some doctors say that masks can stop the flu as much as 80%, but if \n\nyou don't wash your hands often, it's no use wearing a mask. And it's necessary to wear the mask in the groups of people.\n\nDo sports often. Exercises will help make your body strong enough to \n\n the virus.\u00a0\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:When did the H7N9 virus hit Shanghai?\n\nA\uff0eIn March, 2013.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B\uff0eIn May, 2013.\u00a0 C\uff0eIn March, 2012.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?\n\nA\uff0eSome people who were infected with the H7N9 virus had a toothache.\n\nB\uff0eYou should cover your mouth and nose with a piece of paper when you sneeze or cough.\n\nC\uff0eSome doctors say that masks can stop the flu as much as 100%.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:How many ways to stop the virus are mentioned in the passage?\n\nA\uff0eThree.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B\uff0eFour.

The reason is that the colors of locusts change with the colors of crops(\u5e84\u7a3c). When crops are young,locusts look green. But when autumn comes, locusts change to the yellow and brown color as crops do.\n\n Brown bears,tigers and other animals move quietly through forests. They can't be seen easily by their enemies. This is because they have colors similar to the trees. For the same reason, polar bears that live on a land of snow and ice are white. Butterflies and bees living among the flowers are colorful like flowers. Soil insects are mostly dark-colored and they live under the soil(\u571f\u58e4\uff09 in a dark and wet environment.

The British scientist David Cameron has found when an animal eats the tree's leaves, the amount (\u6570\u91cf) of poison increases in the other leaves. \u201cIt's like the injured leaves telephoning the others to fight together against the enemy,\u201d he said. \n\nThe tree also sends defense messages to neighboring plants by giving out a special smell. Golden Wattle trees in the nearby 45 meters will get the message and produce more poison within 10 minutes. Now, if an enemy eats too many of the trees' leaves, he will die.\n\nEvery kind of plant or tree is good at producing a special set of chemicals. Herbivores, like rabbits, can safely eat the leaves of one tree, but they may be poisoned by its neighbor.\n\nIn this way, plants have not only developed their own defense system, but also shared it with others. This makes it impossible for a single animal to destroy even a small area of forest. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:From the first 2 paragraphs, we can learn that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:If animals eat one Golden Wattle tree's leaves, the tree can\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The underlined word \u201cherbivores\u201d in the 5th paragraph probably means animals which \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The last paragraph of the passage suggests that this kind of defense system is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The passage is mainly about \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n\u5c0f\u98985:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/anhyc303294888.html"},

If we don't , we will not have enough time to grow more trees to take the place of those we use for paper .\n\nSo how can we save paper ? We can use both sides of every piece of paper , especially when we are making notes .We can choose drinks in bottles instead of those in paper packets .

Maybe the earth gets warmer and warmer on its own. But many scientists say that people are doing many things which makes the earth warmer.\n\n First, greenhouse effect (\u6e29\u5ba4\u6548\u5e94) is a very important reason for the change of the earth. People give out too much energy into the air every year. It makes the earth warmer. Climate (\u6c14\u5019) change is another important reason. Sometimes it becomes too hot and sometimes too cold. Sometimes there is too much rain and sometimes too little. The change of the climate makes the earth warmer. In turn, the warmth of the earth changes the climate, too.\n\n When the earth becomes warmer, there may be more rain and a rise in sea level. It will affect the growth of plants, animals and people. On a Pacific island, 100 people have to move to higher ground because the sea is rising. These people can no longer live on the coast. Before that, two islands without people went underwater in 1999. Scientists say that the seas can rise by nearly one metre by 2100.\n\n People can affect the earth's air, land and water. As for us, we can do many things to protect the earth.

It is a device(\u88c5\u7f6e) which uses satellites (\u536b\u661f) to find the user's position(\u4f4d\u7f6e). It can find your position to within 20 metres. A GPS cannot start your car, but at least you will know where you are.\n\nGPS, which means Global Positioning System, is a small radio receiver. It looks like a mobile phone. You can hold it in your hand, or put in your pocket. It is sometimes put into a watch or a telephone. We also find GPS devices in cars, planes, or boats. Some of these devices have electronic maps, so you know where you are. For example, in a city they can tell you the name of the street.\n\nThere are three parts to the Global Positioning System. The first part is the receiver. You can hold it in your hand, or have it fixed into your car, plane, etc. The second part is a group of satellites orbiting the Earth. The receiver contacts at least four of the satellites and calculates(\u8ba1\u7b97) its position. The third part of the system is a network of ground stations. They are all over the world. \n\n control the satellites and make sure they are working well.\n\nSome people think that in the future the GPS will be as common as the mobile.

One ear is usually closer to the source (\u6765\u6e90) of a sound than the other ear is. Sound waves are stronger when they reach the ear that is closer. They also reach the closer ear first.

Research has shown that a cup of coffee does give a person slight excitement. \n\nLegend said that Kaldi, an Ethiopian, found his goats happier while enjoying coffee plants. Curiously, he tasted the leaves and began to dance around. Whether the Legend was true or not, the discovery of coffee dates back to 800A. D. Soon Arabians were roasting coffee beans. Muslims were drinking coffee to stay awake by 1000 A.D. A merchant from Venice introduced coffee to Europe in 1615. By 1696, the Dutch started growing the coffee bush in Java. By 1723, coffee plants were introduced to the Americans. Today, coffee is the most popular drink in the world.\n\nCaffeine is the major chemical in coffee. It blocks(\u963b\u6b62) adenosine, a chemical that makes you sleepy. People can get a pick-me-up or stimulation(\u523a\u6fc0) from the drink. The stimulation does not last long. Caffeine poisoning can occur if more than 400 milligrams of caffeine is drunk in a short period, which is about four to five cups of coffee. Caffeine will also cause sleep difficulty, so it should not be drunk before bed.\n\nCaffeine has many advantages. Studies have shown that it helps improve some skills in elderly women. Women who drank three cups of coffee daily scored higher on memory tests than women who drank one cup of coffee. According to newser.com, one cup of coffee a day protects the brain. Coffee also can help people keep away from many diseases according to webmd.com.\n\nLarge amounts of coffee can cause nervousness, worries and a fast heartbeat.

It is necessary to give him a transfusion (\u8f93\u8840) because he has lost much blood in the accident. However, special care must be taken in selecting new blood for him. If the blood is too different from his own, the transfusion can kill him.\n\nThere are four basic blood groups: A, B, AB and O. A single test can tell us a person's blood group. Everybody is born with one of these four blood groups. People's blood group, like hair colour, is inherited (\u7ee7\u627f) from parents. \n\nBecause the substances contained in each group are different, transfusion must be given carefully. Basically, A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. O can be given to any other group, so it is often called the universal donor. On the contrary, AB is sometimes called the universal recipient (\u63a5\u53d7\u8005). However, before being given the transfusion, patients usually receive only salt or plasma (\u8840\u6d46) until their blood can be matched as exactly as possible. In this way, it is possible to avoid any bad results of the transfusion.\n\nThere is a relationship between our blood groups and our nationalities. Among the Europeans, about 42 percent are blood group A while 45 percent are blood group O. The rarest is blood group AB.

As water becomes less and polluted more, conservation (\u4fdd\u62a4) becomes more and more important. The less water you use, the less wastewater will end up in our rivers and lakes. Wasting water means that more water needs to be treated and cleaned, a process that requires quite a lot of energy.\n\nAs it is said above, cutting down on water usage is one of the most important things you can do for your local environment and the planet as a whole. That is why more green households are going blue: cutting down their water footprint by conserving and harvesting (\u6536\u83b7) water.\n\nIt may seem like a big concept, but going blue starts with small changes that everyone can make. Something as simple as turning off the tap while you brush your teeth can save a lot of water. Wash your fruits and vegetables in a bowl rather than under a tap to save even more. Make sure that the taps are fully turned off every time you step away from the sink or the shower \u2014 all those little drips can add up to a lot of water waste.\n\nAnother way of reducing your water footprint is reducing your dependence on the main water supply. Rainwater harvesting can meet a lot of your home's water needs. Many of us already practice rainwater harvesting in a small way. Collecting water from your gutters (\u6a90\u6c9f) is a great way to keep your garden green without running the sprinkler (\u6d12\u6c34\u5668).\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The underlined word \u201c\n\n\u201d means \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ in this passage.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:According to the passage, which is NOT the reason that people should save water?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, all of these can be used to save water except \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following is the best title of this passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:From the passage, we can know that\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n\u5c0f\u98985:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/4k7yc303291547.html"},

Bottle-feeding or mother's milk? \u00a0Full-time parental care or a child-minder(\u513f\u7ae5\u4fdd\u80b2\u5458)? These problems always trouble the parents a lot. And now, there is a book called Childsplay dealing with the problem of child-care.\n\nThe author of Childsplay, Lucy Jackson, believes most school children do some sports at school. And many adults take regular exercise in their free time.\n\n Babies, though, spend most of the time in front of the television or sitting in a push-chair (\u6298\u53e0\u5f0f\u5a74\u513f\u8f66) or high chair. If the world were a safer place, every child would run around freely, but that is simply not possible. As a result, they become lazy, overweight and unfit.\n\n Ms. Jackson is worried that if small children take no regular exercise, bad habits will continue into adulthood (\u6210\u4eba\u671f ). She suggests that parents should begin exercising with very small babies, moving their legs and arms gently in time to music. As children grow, they should follow and exercise program using soft balls, household furniture and play equipment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Many experts in child development do not agree. They feel that children will learn to run and jump as they play naturally; they do not need planned exercise. They would not be overweight if they ate healthier food. An increasing number of parents, though, are taking their children to exercise classes. The kids jump around with their mothers to disco music.They seem to enjoy themselves, but it is not at all clear if the classes have any effect on their future development.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:According to the passage, the parents do not worry about how to care about their children.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Childsplay is a book about how to take care of the children.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Ms. Jackson doesn't believe babies take enough exercise.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Ms. Jackson encourages parents to take exercise with their babies.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Though we don't know if the exercise will have any effect on children future development, some mothers have already taken their children to exercise.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:F\n\u5c0f\u98982:T\n\u5c0f\u98983:T\n\u5c0f\u98984:T\n\u5c0f\u98985:T\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/tbs6c303291570.html"},

Yes. If you are five and move to another country, you will quickly pick up the language. But what about for the rest of us who are no longer five, and need to be polite when traveling for business or for pleasure? I think that answer is also yes. Language learning can be easy if you don't want or need to learn too much. \n\nThe key to successful language learning in my mind is not to set the goal too high. It is rather like running. Even if you run twice a week, you don't necessarily want to be able to run a marathon (\u9a6c\u62c9\u677e). You might just want to keep a level of fitness. I think the same can be true for language learning. \n\nLet's get back to the goal. If you decide to learn ten words in a foreign language before visiting the country, you know that you will be sure to do this. However, if you decide to talk to people with great fluency (\u6d41\u5229), unless you are quite a talented person, you will probably fail and give up in half-way. \n\nIt is also far easier to start learning a foreign language than to finish. In other words, the better you are, the slower it can be to improve, because you will not be able to move further because of grammar, making sentences, learning less common words, etc. If you are only trying to learn a few foreign words and sentences, you will enjoy faster progress, have more fun, and won't have to spend too much time. \n\nThe idea of learning only a few hundred words in a language, and then stopping, isn't the usual way to language learning, but it can be a very meaningful and enjoyable activity. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:In the writer's opinion, it is easy for adults to learn English if \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The writer believes that if you want to be good at a foreign language, you will probably \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The best title of this passage would be \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/z4rmc303291660.html"},

And what about those rainbow swirls\uff08\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09 you see in soap bubbles? The rainbow colors stay even when the bubbles frost, but they don't swirl anymore. The bubbles still stay in the air. They don't fall to the ground any faster than they would on a warm summer day.\n\nWhen these frozen bubbles break, they don't turn into small water drops as summer bubbles do. They turn into flashing rainbow confetti\uff08\u788e\u5c51\uff09 and move slowly to the ground. Sometimes a frozen bubble will roll across the snow without breaking. If nothing disturbs the bubble, it may stay there for a long time.

Songs that get stuck in your head go round and round, sometimes for days, sometimes for months. For no clear reason you cannot help yourself from humming or singing a tune by Lady Gaga.\n\nTo a psychologist, the most interesting thing about earworms is that they show a part of our mind that is clearly outside of our control. Earworms arrive without permission and refuse to leave when we tell them to. They are parasites (\u5bc4\u751f\u866b) living in a part of our minds.\n\nIf you have got an earworm you can suffer an attack of it simply by someone mentioning the tune, without having to hear it. This proves that earworms are a part of long-term memory. Humans have an \"inner ear\", for remembering phone numbers, for instance. When it gets infected with earworms, rather than review our plans for the day, or lists of things to remember, the inner ear gets stuck on a few short bars of music or a couple of phrases from a song. A part of us that we normally do not have to think about, that should just do what we ask, has been turned against us, upsetting us with a request that we never asked for. The mind is an inner world which we do not have complete knowledge of, or have control over.\n\nFortunately psychology can provide some advice on how to deal with an uncontrollable mind. Consider the famous \"don't think of a white bear\" problem, which tells you to try not to think about white bears, or to do something else, to avoid both thinking of the white bear and not thinking of the white bear. For earworms, the solution may be the same. Our inner ear has become infected with an earworm. This is a part not under our control, so just sending in instructions to \"shut up\" is unlikely to be of much help (and has been shown to make it worse).

For a long time, many scientists thought that only people could act generously just because it feels good. \n\nHowever, a new study in Germany suggests that chimpanzees (\u9ed1\u7329\u7329)also do good things for no real reason. And so do children who are as young as 18 months of age. Maybe it is because humans and chimpanzees share an ancestor(\u7956\u5148) about 6 million years ago.\n\n People and chimpanzees appear to develop such features(\u7279\u5f81) without any other training, says Warneken, a scientist in Germany. Warneken and his partners worked on adult chimpanzees that live on an island in the African country of Uganda. They also worked with 18-month-old children in Germany. The researchers performed three experiments on the adult chimpanzees and two experiments on the kids. In the first animal experiment\uff0ca person tried to reach his arm into a cage to get a stick\uff0cbut he couldn't reach it. A chimpanzee was in the cage\uff0cand it could reach the stick if it wanted to.\n\nThirty-six chimpanzees took part in this experiment one by one, and no chimpanzee saw what the other chimpanzees had done. Even though the animals hadn't met the person before, they usually took the stick and gave it to the person. What's more, they did this whether or not the person offered them bananas as a reward. In a similar experiment, 36 children acted in a similar way. They helped the person reach the stick, whether or not they were offered toys for their help.\n\nResearchers did other experiments on chimpanzees and babies. No rewards were offered in either experiment. And still, both the chimpanzees and children went out of their way to help. Still, the new study is different from earlier findings. Researchers have found that chimpanzees don't give rewards of food to other chimpanzees, even if it costs them nothing to be generous.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Warneken and his partners worked with \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:A new study in Germany suggests that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage\uff1f\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:From the passage we know that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/2msbc303291481.html"},

But waves breaking on the beach make the ocean fun. When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind.\n\nLet's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles \uff08\u7c92\u5b50\uff09 of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball.\n\n\u3000\u00a0 So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore\uff1fWhen a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because\n\nmeets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest(\u6d6a\u5cf0), keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is really moving forward when you look at the wave.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Match the sentences with the pictures and the right answer.\n\n(1) The basketball moves up to the top with the wave.\n\n(2) The basketball continues and leaves the basketball behind.\n\n(3) When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The underlined word \u201cit\u201d ( Paragraph 3) refers to \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The main idea of this passage is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n\u5c0f\u98985:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/baqlc303290429.html"},

For the first time, scientists have made a robot that can take a beating and keep on going. Scientists from Cornell University made the robot, which looks like a spider with four legs.\n\nUntil now, even the most advanced (\u5148\u8fdb\u7684) robot was almost certain to break down when it was damaged (\u6bc1\u574f). That is because its computer inside simply doesn't know how to make the machine work after its shape has changed.\u00a0\n\nTo deal with this problem, the scientists put eight motors (\u53d1\u52a8\u673a) and two sensors (\u4f20\u611f\u5668) that read how the machine is working. They all give signals to the machine's software. Using this information, the computer can then figure out the machine's shape at any moment.\n\nThe new technology is a big advance in robot-making, scientists say, and it's far from scary. It may someday help scientists create better artificial (\u5047\u7684) arms and legs and give new freedom to people who lose \n\n. It might also help scientists understand how people and animals figure out their own sense of place in space.\n\n\u201cIt has been difficult to design robots that can work well when the environment changes or when it's damaged,\u201d says Olaf Sporns of Indiana University in US. \u201cWith this work, we are nearer to solving this problem.\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Why do robots easily break down when they are damaged?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The new technology(\u6280\u672f) allows the robot to \n\n.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The underlined word \u201cthem\u201d in Paragraph 5 refers to \n\n.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:How do the sensors in the robot work?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/1xuoc303290713.html"},

Each page of it is numbered, so you only have to dial the number to choose which subject you want to read about. There are all kinds of information ---everything is included from cooking to the latest sports news.\n\nIf you want to read the news, the first thing you have to do is to turn to the back page, which has an easy-to-remember page number, 100 for example. Then you start choosing what you want to read. The news is on page 101 to 109, so you put in the numbers and the news appears written across your screen. Perhaps you want to go out in the afternoon, so you press 181, and a brightly colored weather map appears on the screen. But the weather is terrible, so you decide to go shopping and dial 162 for a list of the week's best bargains. But should you drive or take the train? To answer that question you only have to press 189 for the traffic report. It is very simple to use. But probably the best thing about the service is that it is being updated all the time. Journalists type new material directly onto the screen and the whole pages of the magazine can be replaced in minutes.\n\nLondon already has three services. One, sent out by TV, is called ORACLE while the other two, on BBC, are called CEEFAX because they let you see facts. Although CEEFAX and ORACLE have been operating for some time, they have not been well publicized(\u5ba3\u4f20).

The following are some of the new rules.\n\nTell the truth. Have you ever copied someone else's work on an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something an honest student should do. If you have played computer games for two hours in your room, don't tell your parents you have done homework.\n\nDo more at school. Good students love animals and care for other people. April is Bird-loving month in China. Is your school doing anything to celebrate? You should join! In that way, you can learn more about animals and how to protect them. When more people work together, it makes it more fun for everyone.\n\nHave you ever quarreled with your teammates when your basketball team lost? Only working together can make your team stronger. Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself.\n\nBe open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll discover Earth \u2161 some day. Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone.\n\nProtect yourself. Has someone ever taken money from one of your classmates? Don't let it happen to you. If you have to go home late, you should let your parents know.\n\nUse the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for your studies. But some things on the Internet aren't for kids, so try to look at web pages that are good for you. You can use the web for fun or homework. Can't you find any good websites for children?

When kids break rules, parents will give them some punishments, which aren't included in rules. In fact, when you tell your kids about a new rule, you should talk with them about the price they should pay for breaking the rule \u2014 what the punishment will be.\n\nPunishments you set should be reasonable, without violence or threat (\u66b4\u529b\u6216\u5a01\u80c1). For example, if you find your son smoking, you may limit his social activities for two weeks. You should punish your kids only in ways you have discussed before the rule is broken. A study shows that the most popular punishment is to limit kids' TV time.\n\nIt's understandable that you'll be angry when rules are broken. Punishment is a way to express your anger, but it's not a very good one. Sharing your feelings of anger, disappointment or sadness with your kids can have a better effect (\u6548\u679c) on them.

In space, they get to do some pretty amazing things, like floating in zero gravity(\u91cd\u529b).\n\n However, there are also plenty of things that astronauts can't do because of their weightless environment, and that's very sad. What's worse, they can't even let their sadness show, because it's impossible to cry in zero gravity.\n\n Of course, astronauts can still produce tears. But crying is much more difficult in space, according to The Atlantic(\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u6708\u520a) in January. Without gravity, tears don't flow(\u6d41\u52a8) down out of the eyes like they do here on Earth. This means that when you cry in space, your tears have nowhere to go-they just stick(\u7c98) to your eyes.\n\n In May 2011, astronaut Andrew Feustel experienced this during one of his spacewalks. \"Tears,\" he said, \"don't fall off of your eyes...They just kind of stay there.\"\n\n Besides making your vision(\u89c6\u7ebf)unclear, this can also cause physical pain. Back on Earth, tears are supposed to bring comfort to the eyes. But that's not the case in space. The space environment dries out astronauts' eyes, and when tears suddenly wet the eyes, it can cause pain rather than comfort. \"My right eye is stinging(\u523a\u75db) like crazy,\" Feustel told his teammate during the walk.\n\n Since gravity doesn't work in space, astronauts need some extra help to get rid of\uff08\u9664\u53bb\uff09 the tears. Feustel chose to rub his eyes against his helmet to wipe(\u64e6) the tears away. Another choice is to just wait-\"When the tears get big enough they simply break free of the eyes and float around,\" astronaut Ron Parise told The Atlantic.\n\n There are lots of small things-things like crying-that we are so used to on Earth. We usually take them for granted until they become a problem in a totally different environment, like space.\u00a0 There, astronauts can't talk to each other directly. They also can't eat or drink in normal ways. They can't even burp (\u6253\u55dd), because there is no gravity to hold the food down in their stomach. If they do burp, they just end up throwing up\uff08\u5455\u5410\uff09everything in their stomach, according to the UK National Space Center.\n\n Therefore, perhaps it's only space explorers who can honestly say: \"Gravity, you're the best.\"\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:From Paragraphs 2 and 3 , we can know that\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What effect do tears have on astronauts?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The underlined phrase \"take them for granted\" in paragraph 7 means \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The second-to-last paragraph (paragraph 7) is mainly about\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/gptzc303291288.html"},

This year's slogan is \u201cBreathe Easily, Sleep Well\u201d. Its aim is to celebrate the *benefits of good and healthy sleep. \n\nFangfang, from Liaoning, just became a high school student last September. She gets up at 5:30 a.m. every day and goes to bed at about midnight. Fangfang feels sleepy all the time. \u201cI want to finish all my homework first,\u201d she said.\n\nSleep is like food for the brain. Enough sleep helps the body and brain grow and develop. According to the National Sleep *Foundation in the US, adults need seven to nine hours of sleep every night. For students who are 10 to 17 years old, a healthy amount is about eight to nine hours every night. \n\nBut many students don't get enough sleep because of early school start time and heavy homework. About 80 percent of middle school students don't get enough sleep, the China Youth and Children Research Center reported. For some students, they want to sleep early, but they keep worrying about their schoolwork and can't fall asleep quickly. For others,they may even have \n\n, and usually they have to ask the doctors for help. \n\nThese sleeping problems greatly *affect people's life. Some doctors found out that *lack of sleep for teenagers lead to poor grades. Students without enough sleep cannot pay attention in class or do well in sports. Also, they often become anxious easily. \n\nLuckily, with good sleep habits, it is easier to fall asleep. Some of these good habits include *avoiding drinks that make people excited late in the day, going to sleep at the same time every night, and sleeping in a comfortable place that is dark, quiet, and neither too warm nor too cold. \n\nMore tips to get a good night's sleep:\n\nExercising during the day. You'd better do sports three hours before going to bed.\n\nDon't eat big meals before bedtime. Drink a warm glass of milk.\n\nIf you stay awake worrying about things, try making a list of things that you need to do before you go to bed.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:\n\nHow much sleep do students aged from 10 to 17 need every night?\u00a0\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:\n\nWhat does the word \u201c\n\n\u201d mean in Paragraph 4? \n\n\u5c0f\u98983:\n\nIf teenagers don't get enough sleep, they may \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\u00a0\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:\n\nWhich of the following is a good sleeping habit according to the passage? \u00a0\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:\n\nWhat is the main idea of the passage? \u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "answer": " \n\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/03oxc303289414.html"},

I thought the whole building was on fire. I said to God quietly, \"Just get me out of here. I'll never be bad again.\"\n\nJust then, I realized the lift was moving very slowly.

Firstly, it helps to keep us healthy. We all need fresh(\u65b0\u9c9c\u7684) air. And air is the freshest early in the morning. Besides(\u6b64\u5916), it is useful to do morning exercises.\n\nSecondly, early rising helps us in our studies. In the morning we learn more quickly and find it easier to understand what we learn.\n\nThirdly, early rising can give us a plan of our work for the day. We cannot work well without a good plan.\n\nFourthly, early rising gives us enough time to get ready for our work, such as to wash our hands and faces and eat our breakfast.\n\nLate risers may find it difficult to form(\u5f62\u6210) the habit(\u4e60\u60ef) of early rising. They have to make an effort(\u52aa\u529b) to do so.

Here is a 5R rule for us:\n\n1\uff0eReduce\n\nIf you want to reduce waste, you should use things wisely. Millions of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses a little paper carelessly and throw it out, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the waste\n\n2\uff0eReuse\n\n You should always think of reusing the usable things before throwing them out. Give your clothes you do not use or the ones which are too small to the poor. With a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters.\n\n3. Recycle\n\n Bottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so, we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed flat\uff08\u538b\u5e73\uff09and melted\uff08\u878d\u5316\uff09and the melted things are made for new coke cans.\n\n4\uff0eRecover\n\n When you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten\uff08\u8150\u70c2\u7684\uff09apples, You have two choices: one is to throw the whole apple away, or you could cut off the rotten parts and eat the good parts. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food.\n\n5. Repair\n\nIf one of the legs of your table is broken, you can repair it instead of throwing it away. If you want to change for better ones, It is better for you to sell the old things or give them to other people who can use them after doing some repair. It is true that North America is a \"throw\uff0daway\" society(\u793e\u4f1a).But the time has come to change our way of life so that we can protect our environment.

Perhaps this will be true one day, but if the world has no schools, I can't imagine how our society will be. In fact, we should learn how to use new technology to make schools better. We should invent a new kind of school connected to libraries, museums, science centers, labs and even companies. Technological companies should create learning programs for schools. Scientists could give talks through the Internet. TV networks and local stations could develop programs about things students are studying in school. Labs could set up websites to show new technology, so students could see it on the Internet.\n\nIs this a dream? No. There have been many cities where this is beginning to happen. Here the whole city is connected to the Internet, and learning can take place at home, at school, and in the office. Businesses provide programs for the schools and the society. The schools provide computer labs for people without their own computers at home. Because everyone can go on the Internet, older people use it as much as younger ones, and everyone can visit faraway libraries and museums as easily as nearby ones.

Nearly all people think it's impossible, but there are some more earthquakes in recent years.\n\nAnimals can predict the weather or other natural events. It may sound strange, but farmers living in the countryside think so. For hundreds of years , they have observed animals. \n\n \u201cAnimals ' behavior can be connected to future weather conditions or events.\u201d They say. For example, if cows lie down, a rainstorm is coming. There are many traditional stories connecting animals and natural events. Many people think that these stories don't have scientific evidence( \u6839\u636e ) at all. Scientists, however, are beginning to take another look at some of these ideas. \n\n A Japanese earthquake researcher named Kiyoshi Shimamura noticed an increase in dog bites a short time before earthquake hit. Then he did research on twelve public health centers in Kobe, Japan. These health centers treated people after the 1995 earthquake . He got some interesting information about the month before the big earthquake:\u00a0 treatment for animals' bites had increased . In fact, aggressive(\u4fb5\u7565\u7684)behavior in dogs, such as biting and barking loudly , jumped 60 percent.\n\n There are also other changes in animals' behavior before the earthquake. For example, fish began swimming together in large groups , but only in the middle of the water and not near the edges. Birds flew away from their nests for many days, leaving their eggs unprotected . These animals' behavior suggests that animals may be able to predict natural events better than people.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What would cows behave before a rainstorm?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What do dogs begin to do just before an earthquake?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following animals behave strangely before an earthquake according to this passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:In Kiyoshi Shimamura's investigation(\u8c03\u67e5)\uff0cbefore the big earthquake, treatment for animals'\u00a0 bites had \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:What is the main idea of the passage?\n\n", "answer": " \n\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/38buc303289948.html"},

Many birds and animals lived beside the water, which was full of fish. Now there are few birds, animals, and fish. The lake water is polluted. It is in a colour of dirty brown, and it is filled with strange plants.\n\nHow did this happen? First, we must think about how water gets into Lake Ponkapog. When it rains, water comes into the lake from all around. In the past, there were forests all round Lake Ponkapog, so the rainwater was clean. \n\nNow there are many homes around the lake. People often use the chemicals (\u5316\u5b66\u5236\u54c1)in their gardens. They use other chemicals inside their houses for cleaning and killing insects. There are also many businesses. Businesses use chemicals in their machines of shops. Other chemicals fall onto the ground from cars or trucks. When it rains, the rainwater picks up all the chemicals from home and businesses and then carries them into the lake . They pollute the water and kill the animals.\n\nBoats on the lake are also a problem. Lake Ponkapog is a popular place for motorboats\uff08\u6c7d\u8239\uff09. But oil and gas from boats often get into the lake. So more bad chemicals go into the water this way.\n\nPeople in Hartwell are worried . They love their lake and want to save it. Will it be possible? A clean lake must have clean rainwater going into it. Clean rainwater is possible only if people are more careful about chemicals at home and at other chemicals on the ground. And they mustn't use motorboats any more on the lake. All these may change people's lives.

The study found that a person's happiness depends on the happiness of people he connects with. Surprisingly, it also found that happiness spreads not only between direct friends, but also among friends of your friends' friends! And those good feelings seem to have the greatest influence among friends of the same sex (\u6027\u522b).\n\n\u201cPeople with more good friends are less likely to develop depression (\u60c5\u7eea\u4f4e\u843d) and worry,\u201d says Dr. Toupey Luft. \u201cThough you can't choose your family or workmates, you do have control over friendships.\u201d With a little effort, you can add more positive (\u6b63\u9762\u7684,\u79ef\u6781\u7684) relationships to your social circle. Here're the suggestions:\n\n\u201cNobody is all positive or all negative,\u201d says Luft. \u201cBut there are people you may feel more positive. Use that as your way to check people and keep records.\u201d When spending time with others, pay attention to your feeling. Are you feeling tired and unhappy\uff1fTo help you keep records, Luft suggests taking a moment when you get home to write down what your feeling is when around them.\n\nWhile it's great to gather with positive friends, it's also good to stay with others in the same life situations. \u201cBut if you're all just complaining (\u62b1\u6028) and nothing is changing, it's not healthy,\u201d says Luft. Are your friends negative, or are you doing most of the complaining? Considering the answers to these questions can help you decide if you want to stand in front of them. Or you could let the relationship disappear slowly.\n\nSometimes your hobbies can lead to true friendships. Check out newspapers and websites to find a group or class for something you enjoy. These friends can always be there for you and can care each other through difficulties, illness and death.\n\nNot into groups? Look for individual (\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684) communication instead. Luft says, \u201cSet small goals, such as having coffee with one new person, and develop friendship according to a plan. If someone suggests going for lunch sometime, set a date.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you're feeling disappointed (\u5931\u671b) with a friend, try talking about what you both need,\u201d says Luft. For example, tell her what you want during hard times in your lives. \n\n With some friends you laugh and have fun together at the movies\u2014and that can be enough. With others, you pay attention to your deep connection.\n\nWhat does your happiness depend on, according to the passage?\n\nWhat does the first suggestion want us to do?\n\nWhich of the following is true?\n\nThe underlined sentence in the last paragraph means that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/7zjrc203314433.html"},

Disappointed with his low marks, he went to the library to find a book on how to use his brain. He was directed to the medical section. Confused, he said to the librarian, \u201cI don't want to take my brain out, I just want to learn how to use it.\u201d Her reply was simple: \u201cThere's no book on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought to myself,\u201d says Buzan, \u201cif I buy a little radio, I get an instruction manual (\u8bf4\u660e\u4e66). If I buy a microwave, I get an instruction manual. But for the most important machine in the world, no instruction manual?\u201d\n\nFifty years later, Buzan has become the world's leading speaker on the brain and learning. In the late 1960s, he invented the mind map, a visual representation of thought processes.\n\n This kind of thinking has become a popular tool for planning, organizing, problem solving, and communicating across the world. He has since authored and co-authored over 100 books that have appeared in more than 30 languages.\n\n\u201cI think in most cases, people use less than 1 percent of their brains,\u201d he says.\n\nBut how do you expand this 1 percent? How do you become the best student you can be?\n\nAccording to Buzan, the answer is simple. You take a section of whatever it is that you are trying to learn, he says, and you read it for its essence (\u7cbe\u9ad3\u3001\u8981\u7d20). Then you make a mind map of all the important details. For a truly effective mind map, you start with a colored image in the center of your page. Draw the first image that comes to mind on the topic you are mind mapping. Branch off from your central image and create one of your main ideas. From your main branches draw some sub-branches and from those sub-branches you can draw even more branches. He emphasizes that you should use plenty of images and colors as these help with memory recall and encourage creativity.\n\nBy using this visual format (\u5f62\u5f0f), according to Buzan, your mind will begin to make associations that will help you remember more information for longer periods of time.\n\nBuzan believes that traditional note-taking methods, such as lists and summaries, do not \n\n the brain's recall capacity or ability in the same way.

It is the fifth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 4, and was announced on October 4, 2011. Siri on iPhone 4S is like a person assistant. It lets you use your voice to do things on the iPhone. You can just talk to Siri as you talk to a person. Siri understands what you say, knows what you mean, and even talks back.\n\n Say something like \u201cTell my wife I'm running late.\u201d \u201cRemind me to call the doctor.\u201d\u201cAny fast food restaurants around here?\u201d Siri does what you say, finds the information you need, then answers you. It's like you're having a conversation with your assistant.\n\n Siri not only understands what you say, but it's also smart enough to know what you mean. So when you ask, \u201cAny fast food restaurants around here?\u201d Siri will reply, \u201cI found a number of restaurants near you.\u201d Then you can say, \u201cHmm. How about French fries?\u201d Siri remembers that you just asked about restaurants for something to eat, so it will look for KFC restaurants in the neighborhood. And Siri is active, so it will question you until it finds what you're looking for.\n\n When you want to do something, just ask Siri to help you do it. Siri uses almost all the built-in apps on iPhone 4S. It writes texts and sends email messages. It searches the web for anything you need to know. It plays the songs you want to hear. It gives you directions and shows you around. It makes calls, plans meetings, helps you remember and wakes you up. In fact, ask Siri what it can do \u2014 it even speaks for itself.\n\n Siri is easy to use and does so much. You'll keep finding more and more ways to use it.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:When was iPhone 4S announced?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What is Siri on iPhone 4S like?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:How can you use Siri to do things on the iPhone?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Why will Siri look for KFC restaurants in the neighborhood?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:What does the writer want to tell us according to the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:On October 4, 2011.\n\u5c0f\u98982:A person assistant.\n\u5c0f\u98983:By using your voice. / By talking to Siri.\n\u5c0f\u98984:Because Siri remembers that you just asked about restaurants for something to eat.\n\u5c0f\u98985:The advantages of Siri and how to use it.\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/8ej6c303289056.html"},

Plants take water from the ground through their roots and take carbon dioxide (\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3) from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose (\u8461\u8404\u7cd6). Glucose is a kind of sugar, which plants use as food for energy and growing. \n\nThe way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis that means \u201c putting together with light\u201d. A chemical called chlorophyll helps photosynthesis. It gives plants their green colour. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter, and trees \u201cknow\u201d to begin getting ready for winter. \n\nDuring winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. Trees rest during this time and live on the food they store during the summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. \n\nAs the green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves. Small amounts of these colours have been in the leaves all along. We just can't see them in the summer, because they are covered up by the green chlorophyll. \n\nThe bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, like maples (\u67ab\u6811), glucose is caught in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn this glucose into a red colour. The brown colour of trees like oaks (\u6a61\u6811) is made from waste left in the leaves. \n\nIt is the mixture of all these things that makes the beautiful colours we enjoy during autumn. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The word \u201cchlorophyll\u201d in the third paragraph means \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ in Chinese. \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The leaves of the trees in autumn turn yellow because of the short of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The way that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is called Photosynthesis . \n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following is NOT true?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:This passage tells us \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n\u5c0f\u98985:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/dup2c303287677.html"},

Here are some fun things that you might not know about frogs. Enjoy!\n\nThe Biggest and the Smallest Frogs\n\nSome frogs can be very big. The biggest kind of frog is the Goliath Frog in West Africa. Its body can be nearly 30cm long, about the size of a large cat. The Gold Frog and the Poison Frog are the smallest frogs in the world. They are less than 1cm long. Though the Poison Frog is very small, it is not weak at all. It is dangerous. Any animal that eats it will die very soon.\n\nThe Best Jumpers\n\nFrogs are very good at jumping. They developed jumping legs so that they would not be eaten by other large animals. Using their big strong legs, more frogs can jump over 20 times their own length. The Australian Rocket Frog can even jump over 2m, which is 50 times its body length (5.5 cm). That might be the reason why frogs are called the best jumpers on the earth.\n\nThe Cryogenic Animal\n\nSome frogs like the Common Wood Frog have a special ability to live in very cold places. When the temperature goes down, they become ice frogs. 2/3of their body water freezes. Their hearts stop, and their breathing stops too. You may think they are dead, but in fact they are not. Maybe we humans can learn the way that the frogs do for medical purpose.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The earliest frogs lived about \n\n\u00a0million years ago.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:\n\n\u00a0can jump over 2m.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What will happen to a Common Wood Frog at very low temperature?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/7hbzc303287742.html"},

When your teacher gives you too much homework, when your team loses an important game, when a friend borrows your favorite thing and then breaks it, you may get really angry.\n\nUsually, your body will tell you when you are angry. For example, you breathe faster, your face turns red, and you may want to break something or hit someone, but sometimes, you hide your anger. For example, you may hide it in your heart. The problem is that if you do this, you may get a headache or your stomach may hurt.\n\nIn fact, it's not good to hide your anger, and it's normal for you to get angry sometimes. But anger must be let out in the right way, without hurting others or yourself.\n\nWhen you get angry, you can talk about it with other people. It's helpful to talk about your anger with an adult, such as parents, a teacher, etc. When you talk about anger, those bad feelings can start to go away. Here are some other things you can do when you start to feel angry: talk to a good friend; count from 1 to 100; give someone a hug(\u62e5\u62b1); go for a bike ride; think about good things, etc.\n\nRemember that how you act when you are angry can make everything better or worse.

Read on, and you will find out the secret.\n\nEvery living thing on the earth is made up of cells(\u7ec6\u80de). Cells grow and make new cells. Most cells are very small and we can't see them with our eyes. Different cells have different uses. Our skin cells are special ones. The cells on the outside of our skin are old dead cells. New skin cells are right under the outside. These are the living skin cells. They work for our bodies. They help protect our bodies and heal cuts.\n\nOur bodies make skin cells all the time. As the old cells fall off, new cells grow in the same place. Each person makes about 18 kg of skin cells during his or her life. Outside skin cells fit together closely with no\n\nbetween them. When you cut yourself, you can harm your skin cells. A small cut will not be harmful. Your skin will quickly heal itself by making new skin cells. How do skin cells work? First, the cells near the cut get bigger and move into the gap. Next, these bigger cells meet in the middle. They form a new layer(\u5c42) of skin cells. Finally, new cells will grow until the gap disappears. In this way, your skin can grow and get well itself. How amazing the small cells are! Next time you have a cut, don't worry about it.

The result has now come out on the website wwww.informedhealthonline.org. \u201cSome pills may not help people live longer. Some pills may even lead to earlier death,\u201d says Professor Peter Sawicki. Scientists also say that the best way to get vitamins is through food instead of having vitamin pills. That is to say, we disagree with the way of taking vitamin C pills.\n\nThere are many simple but useful ways to lower the risk of catching a cold. These include often washing your hands with normal soap(\u80a5\u7682) and water and not touching your face with your hands.

One way is to study the clouds. No two clouds are ever alike. We can see the different kinds of clouds and watch them for signs of changing weather. To forecast the weather, there are three things about clouds. you should look for: movement, colour, and change. As a rule, the higher the clouds, the better the weather. And the lower the clouds, the worse the weather is likely to be. Fair-weather cumulus clouds* are another sign of good weather. These are clouds we often see on warm summer days. Clouds can tell you if a storm is on the way. If the thick, fluffy cumulus clouds get bigger early in the day, then you know it will rain. If there is a sudden, cool and dark thunder* cloud appears, then a storm is about to break out. Colours in the sky tell us about the weather, too. A golden ring around the moon warns us that a storm is on the way. A watery yellow sunset is a sign that rain may be near. The rainbow* has a message, too. The colours of the rainbow come from the sun rays shining through falling rain. If you see the sun in the east and a rainbow in the west, the rain may be coming your way.

Often they see old friends and they talk together about those happy years in school.\n\nEveryone soon comes to watch the football game.

DNA is something that everybody has, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our mother and father, because we get some of their DNA to make our own.\n\nPeople have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Gregor Mendel discovered a special reason why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things named \u201cgenes\u201d in our body. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick made another discovery and found out that those small parts are real messages written in the DNA with a special language.\n\nIn 1961, Marshall Nirenberg and Johann Matthaci found a message in DNA showing how DNA tells the cell\uff08\u7ec6\u80de\uff09to build its parts. Scientists have now found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \u201cword\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 means, we can help save more people from several illnesses.\n\nMost people hope that this will help make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when people begin to know more words and find out lots of other information, we might use it in a wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people from getting jobs.

Have you ever been so worried about something that you have a headache or even can't sleep at night? If so, then you know what stress is. Stress is what you feel when you are worried about something. This worry in your mind can make your body feel bad. You may feel angry, sad, scared, or afraid\u2014\u2014all of which can give you a stomachache or a headache.\n\nHowever, there are different kinds of stress. Some kinds of stress are good and others are bad. Good stress might happen when you're called to answer questions in class or when you have to give a speech. This kind of stress can help you to get things better done. For example, you may do a better job on your test if the stress pushes you to prepare better before the test.\n\nOn the other hand, bad stress can happen if the stress lasts too long. You may not feel well if your parents are fighting, if a family member is sick, if you're having problems at school, or if anything else makes you unhappy every day. That kind of stress isn't going to help you. And it can actually make you sick. \n\nThe best way to fight the stress is to have a balanced life. Make sure you keep your SELF in mind: Sleep, Exercise, Leisure\uff08\u4f11\u95f2\uff09, and Food. If you get enough sleep and eat properly, and if you exercise and leave time for fun, you'll probably feel less stressed.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:feeling\n\u5c0f\u98982:mind\n\u5c0f\u98983:lasts\n\u5c0f\u98984:away\n\u5c0f\u98985:relax\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c1/201408/7bvkc103313410.html"},

Yawning is \n\n Scientists have found that all people yawn. Babies start to yawn even before they are born. The earliest yawn takes place when a baby is still inside its mother. When young children are about one year old, they start to yawn when they see others yawning. That's why scientists seem to think yawning is contagious.\n\n It's no secret that yawning is contagious, but why do we yawn? Well, scientists are not really sure.\n\n Some think we yawn because we feel bored. Recently scientists studied two groups of students between the ages of 17 and 19. One group watched music videos, and the other watched a boring color test. Scientists compared the numbers of their yawns and found that the color test group yawned more times than the video group.\n\n Another reason for yawning has to do with breathing. Some scientists believe that when we are bored or tired, we breathe more slowly. As our breathing slows down, we cannot get rid of \uff08\u53bb\u9664\uff09enough carbon dioxide, our bodies will tell the brains\uff08\u5927\u8111\uff09to breathe deeply. The result is a big yawn.\n\n In 2007, scientists suggested a new reason. They said that the reason why people yawned was to cool down their brains. These scientists found that people who were warmer than others yawned more often.\n\n Scientists are still trying to find out why yawning happens and why it is so contagious.

Many cat owners have seen a cat smell the food and refuses it. Careful sniffing tells the cat if something is safe to eat.\n\nCats have a pair of vomeronasal organs(\u7281\u9f3b\u5668) on the roof of the mouth. When the cat wants to sniff, she will breathe the air in through her mouth. At this moment, she will often squint(\u659c\u89c6) her eyes and maybe even flatten(\u4f7f\u2026\u5e73\u5766) her ears. This makes her look like she is making faces. The vomeronasal organs will then analyze the smell---almost as if the cat is tasting the smell.\n\nWhen you come home from outside the house, your cat can smell what you had for lunch and for a mid-afternoon snack. She can smell the people you shook hands with and your neighbour you stopped to talk to and hug. She can smell the grass brought under your shoes as you took a shortcut across the lawn. Your cat's sense of smell is so good that she can smell difference between a gallon of water with a teaspoon of salt in it and plain water. In comparison, we think of salt as completely tasteless.\n\nCats have scent glands(\u81ed\u817a) on each side of the forehead, on the chin, the lips and next to the tail. When your cat rubs up against your hand, your leg, the sofa, and your bed, she is leaving her scent in those things. She will then use her sense of smell to recognize \u201cher\u201d things, people and even other pets in the home.\n\nIf you want to have fun with your cat's sense of smell, take some small bits of different things, such as a bit of chicken, some flowers and some fish. Place each different scent under a piece of paper towel(so your cat cannot see any of them) and encourage your cat to investigate and find what kind of food she likes to eat best.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Cats know whether the food is fit to eat or not with their\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The third paragraph was written mainly to prove that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What does your cat do when it rubs against your foot?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What does the word \u201cinvestigate\u201d mean in the last paragraph?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The passage mainly tells us \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n\u5c0f\u98985:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/8nccc303314765.html"},

It is because the corridor was built with special kinetic (\u52a8\u80fd\u7684) tiles. When students jump on the tiles, electricity will be generated ( \u4ea7\u751f). After one year, the electricity generated from the tiles can fully charge 853 mobile phones or power(\u4f9b\u7535) an electric car to drive seven miles.

Students can not only play on the corridor,but also help power the lights in their school corridors and other devices ( \u8bbe\u5907) in their classrooms. Besides, this is a good way to teach students to be creative. They will be inspired to be scientists, inventors and engineers in the future to find clean energy for all humans.\n\nThe inventor of the magic corridor tiles is Laurence Kemball-Cook. He was once a student in this school. Now, he is CEO of his own company. The corridor tiles are not Laurence's only invention.

Some people think it is healthy and clean. Others drink bottled water because it's easy \u2014 you can carry it around with you. In hot countries, like Greece, we often buy bottles of cold water in the summer.\n\nHowever, making lots of plastic is not a good idea for many reasons. First of all, we need a lot of oil for plastic products. We usually use oil as a source(\u8d44\u6e90) of energy. If we reduced the number of bottles we made, we wouldn't need so much oil. Plastic bottles also pollute the environment. If we recycled all our plastic bottles, we wouldn't need so much space for rubbish dumps. But in Greece, we don't recycle much of the plastic we use. In 2006, Greeks recycled only about 10% of plastic waste. The rest became rubbish on land and in rivers and sees. So next time you want to throw away a plastic bottle in the litter bin, stop and think. If you recycled it, you would help the environment. But what can you do when there isn't a recycling bin near you? Well, there are loes of useful ways that you can use your bottles again.

Birds, fish and other animals move from one place to another place at a certain time. They move for different reasons: most of them move to find food more easily, but others move to get away from places that are too crowded.\n\nWhen cold weather comes, many birds move to warmer places to find food. Some fishes give birth in warm water and move to cold water to feed. The most famous \n\n is probably the migration of fish, which is called \u201csalmon\u201d(\u9c91\u9c7c). This fish is born in fresh water but it travels many miles to salt water. There it spends its life. When it is old, it will return to its birthplace in fresh water. Then it gives birth and dies. In northern Europe, there is a kind of mouse. They leave their mountain homes when they become too crowded. They move down to the low land. Sometimes they move all the way to the seaside, and many of them are killed when they fall into the sea.\n\nRecently, scientists have studied the migration of a kind of lobster(\u9f99\u867e). Every year, when the season of the bad weather arrives, the lobsters get into a long line and start to walk across the floor of the ocean.

It's a common question, but it will get things going.\" From there you can move on to other matters\u2014sometimes to really personal questions. And how he answers will let you know how far you can go.\n\nSecond, once good talkers have asked questions, they listen to the answers. This point seems clear, but it isn't. Your questions should have a point and help to tell what kind of person you are talking to. And to find out, you really have to listen carefully and attentively. Real listening at least means some things. First it means not to change the topic of conversation. If someone insists on one topic, it means he's really interested in it. Real listening also means not just listening to words, but to the voice. If the voice sounds bored, then, it's time for you to change the topic.\n\nFinally, good talkers know well how to deal with the moment of saying good-bye. If you're saying it, you may give him a handshake and say, \"I've really enjoyed meeting you.\" If you want to see that person again, don't keep it a secret. Let people know your thoughts.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Asking questions might be a quite good and suitable way \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:After asking somebody a question, it'll be polite of you to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Generally speaking, good talkers are persons who \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:If you really want to meet someone again, \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/8dclc303320619.html"},

In fact, non-verbal(\u975e\u8bed\u8a00) communication takes up about fifty percent of what we usually mean. And body language is especially important, when we try to communicate across cultures.\n\nIndeed, what is called body language is so much a part of us that it's actually often unnoticed. And misunderstandings happen as a result of it. For example, different cultures treat the distance between people differently. Northern Europeans usually do not like having bodily contact\uff08\u63a5\u89e6\uff09,even with friends. And certainly not with strangers. People from the Latin American countries, on the other hand, touch each other quite a lot. So it's possible that in conversation it may look like a Latino is following a Norwegian (\u632a\u5a01\u4eba)all over the room. The Latino, trying to express friendship, will keep moving closer. The Norwegian, very probably seeing \n\nas rude behavior, will keep backing away, which the Latino will in return regarded as coldness.\n\nObviously, a great deal is going on when people talk.

As a result, lots of Earth's natural resources will be used up. When we destroy our earth to get natural resources such as wood or oil, animals often lose their living space. They cannot have enough food, and they will get hurt or die.\n\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international charity. It tries to prevent humans from destroying more of nature than is necessary. For example, in China WWF is working with the local government to reconnect (\u91cd\u65b0\u8fde\u63a5) some small lakes in Anhui Province to the Yangtze River and to create(\u521b\u9020) more protected areas so that China's natural beauty will not be lost in the future. WWF works in more than 50 countries, saving rainforests and stopping hunters from killing rare animals and protecting traditional ways of life in areas where they are in danger of being lost. WWF's main goal is to encourage development that does not harm the environment and the animals that live in it.

Finally, he saw something big and white. It was a polar bear, swimming towards him in the icy water.\n\nPaul lay down-on the ice to get a better photo, but the polar bear jumped out of the water and tried to attack him! Luckily for Paul, the ice cracked or broke and the bear fell back into the water The polar bear wasn't so lucky. It couldn't get a meal and had to swim farther away to find food.\n\nTo understand the polar bear's problem, you need to know two things about the Arctic. First, the Arctic is mostly ocean. Second , ice cover a lot of the Arctic Ocean. In winter, the ice form a thick, white sheet, but in summer, the ice becomes thinner and break into pieces. Sea ice is the key to survival for Arctic animals. However, because of global warming, Arctic temperatures are rising and polar ice is melting.\n\nPolar bears need ice to hunt seals, their favourite meal. They stand on the ice wait for the seal to come up for air. As Arctic ice melts, polar bears have to swim farther to find ice floes, or large pieces of floating ice. Sometimes, bears have to swim more than 200 km to find an ice floe. Some bears cannot swim that far and sadly they drown.\n\nOn his last trip, Paul Nicklen saw three dead bodies of polar bears. Before global warming threatened Arctic ice, a dead bear was a rare sight, Paul is sad to see the dead bodies, wildlife experts thinks global warming will have a terrible effect on polar bears. In the future, polar ice will continue to shrink and endanger the bear. Some scientists believe 65 percent of the world's polar bears will disappear by 2050. in other word, polar bears are in great danger.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: The main idea of the passage is that\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\nA. polar bears are amazing swimmers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nB.

Yet doctors in the United States say babies begin learning on their first day of life.\n\nScientists note that babies are strongly influenced by their environment. They say a baby will smile if her mother does something the baby likes. A baby learns to get the best care possible by smiling to please her mother or other caregivers. This is how babies learn to connect and communicate with other human beings.\n\nOne study shows that babies can learn before they are born. The researchers placed a tape recorder on the stomach of a pregnant woman. Then, they played a recording of a short story. On the day the baby was born, the researchers attempted to find if he knew the sounds of the story repeated while in his mother. They did this by placing a device in the mouth of the newborn baby.\n\nThe baby would hear the story if he moved his mouth one way. If the baby moved his mouth the other way, he would hear a different story. The researchers say the baby clearly liked the story he heard before he was born. They say the baby would move his mouth so he could hear the story again and again.\n\nAnother study shows how mothers can strongly influence social development and language skills in their children.\n\nResearchers studied the children from the age of one month to three years. The researchers attempted to measure the sensitivity of the mothers. The women were considered sensitive if they supported their children's activities and did not interfere (\u5e72\u6d89) unnecessarily. They tested the children for thinking and language development when they were three years old. Also, the researchers observed the women for signs of depression (\u6d88\u6c89).\n\nThe children of depressed women did not do as well in tests as the children of women who did not suffer from depression. The children of depressed women did poorly in tests of language skills and understanding what they hear.\n\nThese children also were less cooperative and had more problems dealing with other people. The researchers noted that the sensitivity of the mothers was important to the intelligence development of their children. Children did better when their mothers were caring, even when they suffered from depression.\n\n According to the passage, which of the following is NOT the factor that influences intelligence development in babies?\n\n What is the purpose of the experiment in which newborn babies heard the stories?\n\n Which group of children did the worst in tests of language skills?\n\n What is the main idea of the passage?\n\n", "answer": "", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/kafdc303319504.html"},

Until recently, few people took the saying very seriously. Now however, doctors have begun to study laughter and the effects (\u4f5c\u7528) it has on the human body. They have found evidence that laughter really can improve people's health.\n\nTests were carried out to study the effects of laughter on the body. People watched funny films while doctors checked their heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and muscles. It was found that laughter has similar effects to physical exercise. It increases blood pressure, the heart rate and the rate of breathing. It also works several groups of muscles in the face, the stomach and even the feet. If laughter exercises the body, it must be helpful.\n\nOther tests have shown that laughter appears to make the effect of pain on the body less. In one experiment doctors produced pain in groups of students who listened to different radio programs. The group which could bear the pain for the longest time was the group which listened to a funny program. The reason why laughter can make pain less seems to be that it helps to produce endorphins (\u5185\u5561\u80bd) in the brain. These are natural chemicals which make both stress and pain less.\n\nThere is also some evidence to suggest that laughter helps the body's immune system that is the system which fights infection (\u611f\u67d3). In an experiment, one group of students watched a funny video while another group served as the control group \u2014 in other words, a group with which to compare the first group. Doctors checked the blood of the students in both groups and found that the people in the group that watched the video had an increase in the activity of their white blood cells that is the cells which fight infection.\n\nAs a result of these discoveries, some doctors and psychiatrists (\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u5b66) in the United States now hold laughter clinics, in which they try to improve their patients' condition by encouraging them to laugh. They have found that even if their patients do not really feel like laughing, making them smile is enough to produce good effects similar to those caused by laughter.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: We learn from the first paragraph that laughter\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: Doctors have found that laughter\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following statements is NOT true of laughter according to the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984: Smiling can produce \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985: The main idea of this passage is that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n\u5c0f\u98985:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/coknc303319769.html"},

Perhaps you don't know your emotions can be influenced by the weather as well.\n\nPeople often say they feel good when the sun is shining and sad when it is cloudy.In fact, sunlight makes us feel good.When sunlight hits our skins,our bodies produce a vitamin. Vitamins are natural chemicals(\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8d28)which we all need to stay healthy.Sunlight helps our bodies produce vitamin D.Vitamin D helps our bodies make a special chemical.This special chemical affects our brains(\u5927\u8111)and makes us feel happy.For example, there are long, dark winters of little sunlight in Sweden and Norway,so many peple in these countries often feel sad.Without much sunlight, their bodies produce less vitamin D.Without enough vitamin D, their bodies make less of this special chemical which makes them feel good.To help the people in these countries feel better,special \u201csunrooms\u201dwith artificial(\u4eba\u9020\u7684)lights have been built.People can go there and get \u201csunlight\u201dfor an hour or two!\n\nThe weather can also affect people's emotions in other ways. Hot weather can make people angry because people feel uncomfortable when they are hot. In the same way, rain can make people angry because being wet can be unpleasant. As you can see, the weather can have an effect on the chemicals which control our brains. Through these ways, the weather can influence our emotions.

The simple answer is, \u201cYou can't.\u201d Look around you, everything you see is the result of someone trying new things.\n\nAnother good thing about mistake is this: when you are making mistakes, you are learning.

When he was asked how he felt to fail that many times, he said that he hadn't failed 10,000 times, but rather had learnt 10,000 things that didn't work.\n\nFinally, when you make a mistake, you are that much closer to success. Why? Because you have said what you should say, and you have done what you should do. Every time you make a mistake, you are closer to success. But it doesn't mean that you can make mistakes without thinking. Instead, when you try new things you have to think them over, so that you can keep away from some unnecessary mistakes.\n\nWe shouldn't spend all our time and money on the only one way, but use them correctly. Because our time and money are limited(\u6709\u9650\u7684) .\n\nThere is an old saying, \u201c If you are not making mistakes, you are not trying hard enough.\u201d So go bravely and make mistakes.

In fact, it is not that difficult to learn new words, but to remember them for a lifetime seems not to be so easy.\n\nTo make it easier, you can try word associations\uff08\u8054\u60f3\uff09. Try to find a connection between a new word and things or people you know. For example, if your neighbour is an unselfish person who cares about the needs of other people, think about this person every time you see the word, and very soon you'll start actively using it.\n\nTry to use the words you learn as often as possible. Perhaps you are not sure which situations they should be used in, or whether you pronounce\uff08\u53d1\u97f3\uff09 them correctly, but practice is the best way to understand that. It is not enough to find out the meaning of a word. You should hammer (\u6572\u6253) it into your mind by using it in actual conversations in everyday life.\n\nAlso, it may be helpful to know the meaning of the word roots, prefixes (\u524d\u7f00) and suffixes\u00a0\uff08\u540e\u7f00\uff09\uff0c especially if they have a Greek or Latin origin\uff08\u8d77\u6e90\uff09\uff0e Even if you meet a long unfamiliar word, it will be easy to know its meaning if you know the general meaning of its parts.\u00a0 For example, if you see the word \"philanthropy\", it won't be difficult to\n\n what it means if you know that \"anthropo\" means \"human\" and \"philo\" means \"loving\".

The second meeting place should be outside your neighborhood.\n\nNext, choose a person outside your area who can help your family get in touch with each other. After a disaster, it is often easier to communicate over a long-distance call than a local one. The person can pass messages between your family members.\n\nThen, get a family disaster\n\n ready. It should include things your family needs. It can help you survive (\u751f\u5b58) at least for three days like bread, water, medicine and things like that. Put them in a bag so you can carry it if you leave in a hurry.

The inventor says that it stops rain, wind and snow and can keep your head, face and hair dry.\n\n\u201cI never planned to invent a product. I just noticed a problem and had a new idea,\u201d said the inventor. The idea for the invention began on one rainy day. Mr Kaufman was standing in one of his stores. He began to look at people's umbrellas. He found that they had to try very hard to keep their umbrellas in the right place. At that moment an idea came into his mind. He ran to his desk and drew a picture. In this way, the nubrella was born.\n\nOne cool feature of the nubrella is that you don't hold it like a normal umbrella; you wear it. The shoulder straps (\u80a9\u5e26) of the nubrella allow people to be fully hands-free, so when walking in the rain with the nubrella, you are able to use your cell phone or drink a hot cup of coffee. Also, the nubrella will never be inverted (\u98a0\u5012) in the wind.

In space, they get to do some pretty amazing things, like floating(\u6f02\u6d6e) in zero gravity(\u91cd\u529b).\n\nHowever, there are also plenty of things that astronauts can't do because of their weightless environment, and that's very sad. What's worse, they can't even let their sadness show, because it's impossible to cry in zero gravity.\n\nOf course, astronauts can still produce tears(\u773c\u6cea). But crying is much more difficult in space, according to The Atlantic(\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u6708\u520a) in January. Without gravity, tears don't flow(\u6d41\u52a8) down out of the eyes like they do here on Earth. This means that when you cry in space, your tears have nowhere to go \u2014 they just stick(\u7c98) to your eyes.\n\nIn May 2011, astronaut Andrew Feustel experienced this during one of his spacewalks. \u201cTears,\u201d he said, \u201cdon't fall off of your eyes. They just stay there.\u201d\n\nBesides making your vision(\u89c6\u7ebf) unclear, this can also cause physical pain. Back on Earth, tears are supposed to bring comfort to the eyes. But that's not the case(\u60c5\u51b5) in space. The space environment dries out astronauts' eyes, and when tears suddenly wet the eyes, it can cause pain rather than comfort. \u201cMy right eye is stinging(\u523a\u75db) like crazy,\u201d Feustel told his teammate during the walk.\n\nSince gravity doesn't work in space, astronauts need some extra help to get rid of(\u9664\u53bb) the tears. Feustel chose to rub his eyes against his helmet to wipe(\u64e6) the tears away. Another choice is to just wait \u2014 \u201cWhen the tears get big enough, they simply break free of the eyes and float around,\u201d astronaut Ron Parise told The Atlantic.\n\nThere are lots of small things \u2014 things like crying \u2014 that we are so used to on Earth. We usually \n\n until they become a problem in a totally different environment, like space. There, astronauts can't talk to each other directly. They also can't eat or drink in normal ways. They can't even burp(\u6253\u55dd), because there is no gravity to hold the food down in their stomach. If they do burp, they just end up throwing up(\u5455\u5410) everything in their stomach, according to the UK National Space Center.\n\nTherefore, perhaps it's only space explorers who can honestly say, \u201cGravity, you're the best.\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: From Paragraphs 2 and 3, we can know that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: What effect do tears have on astronauts?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983: The underlined phrase \u201ctake them for granted\u201d in paragraph 7 means \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Paragraph 7 is mainly about \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/zpnzc203318393.html"},

You can give your kids a list of chores that need to be done each week. If they complete these chores, you can give them some money. You can also break the list down and tell them they will get so much for each chore that is finished. Older kids , who like to do things on weekends or buy things like video games, will work hard to complete their chores and earn their money. This is also teaching them responsibility. This is teaching them that they must work for what they want.\n\nIf you are dealing with younger kids, you may want to go with the rewards chart(\u5956\u52b1\u56fe\u8868\uff09. This is where you design a chart and list their chores on the chart. For each chore they complete, you can put a red flower beside it. For the rewards, you canalso do a number of things ,such as going to the park, going out to eat, buying a DVD or something similar. The rewards would be up to you because you know what your kids like.\n\nFor real small kids, you can turn it into a game. When kids were much younger, you can teach them to dance around and sing as you cleaned. The kids loved it and would do a wonderful job at picking up their toys.

Then, they were not allowed to \u201c hang out \u201d with other kids after school. They had to be the top students in their class. And they had to practice the piano and the violin for hours every day. Of course, she believes this has brought a lot of problems for herself and her kids.

She says American mothers are really cats. They care more about their children's self-respect (\u81ea\u5c0a). They don't want to be strict with their kids because this may hurt their feelings.

Many of the world's great cities are located(\u5750\u843d) on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river running through it that plays an important role in the lives of its people. \n\n Since the beginning of the history, people have used rivers for transportation(\u8fd0\u8f93). The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Gangs is great, but it is also important for transportation; Ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeast Asia. The greatest of all for navigation (\u822a\u6d77), however, is the Amazon in Brazil. It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles upon it. \n\n Besides transportation, rivers give food, water to drink, water for crops(\u5e84\u7a3c), and chances for fun and entertainment for the people who live along their banks. In order to increase(\u589e\u52a0) the supply of crops, engineers sometimes build a dam (\u5927\u575d) across a river and let a lake from behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate (\u704c\u6e89) their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. \n\n However, large cities and industries that are located upon rivers often make problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals(\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8d28) and other materials.

It's natural that while feeling in danger, you'll probably want to meet the family before you can calmly move out.\n\nSecond, how do you untie (\u89e3\u5f00) your seat belt on a plane? By lifting a latch. \n\n\u00a0you can't untie your seat belt, you can hardly run away and your chances of survival will drop.\n\nThird, the \n\n\u00a0to the exits (\u9003\u751f\u53e3), the more likely you are to survive. Count exactly how many rows you are from the nearest two exits. Why two exits? Because this helps you find at least \n\n\u00a0even in the sudden dark during an accident.\n\nFourth, we would be safer if airline seats faced backward, according to Galea's research. But the problem is that most of the passengers \n\n\u00a0traveling with their back facing the direction of travel.\n\n Fifth, \u201cSmoke is dangerous to your health. If you take in too much of it, your will die,\u201d explains Galea. You must learn how to use a smoke mask. Without the knowledge of putting on a mask, you'll \n\n\u00a0time trying to put it on\u2014time that could be used to run away.\n\nAt last, listen to the flight attendants before flying and look \n\n\u00a0at everything shown on a video or a safety card. Always be prepared.

The way the earth interacts with the sun's energy can be displayed in a picture called the earth's energy budget\uff08\u9884\u7b97\uff09. It displays the sun's energy that reaches us and how much of that energy is taken in and how much is thrown back by the earth and its air. Once the energy reaches the earth, some of it is taken by land and oceans. The amount of energy that is taken in influences the temperatures. The energy that is not taken in is thrown back to space.\n\nGenerally, the amount of energy coming in is \n\n the amount of energy going out. So, we say the earth's energy budget is balanced. If more energy was coming in than was going out, the earth's temperature would increase. On the other hand, if too much energy is thrown back, and not taken in, we would see the earth's temperature dropping.\n\nOf all of the sun's energy that hits the earth, about 67% is taken in by the land, oceans, air and clouds and about 33% is thrown back into space.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The picture above shows us how \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ hits the earth.\n\nA. the high temperature\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B. the heavy rain\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C. the sun's energy\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:In the 2nd paragraph, the underlined phrase \u201cequal to \u201d means \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d.\n\nA. less than\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B. the same as \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C. more than\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Picture \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ shows us the main idea of the last paragraph.\n\n A. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0B. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:If too much energy is thrown back, we will feel \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_on the earth.\n\nA. cold\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B. hot\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 C. warm\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:The amount of energy that is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ influences the temperatures.\n\nA. well balanced\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nB. thrown back\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nC. taken in\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n\u5c0f\u98985:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/4eyec303317435.html"},

The idea behind Lt is simple - the larger fish are probably older. If you keep the smaller ones, they won't be able to reproduce, and the fish population is in danger.\n\nBut fishing out the largest fish from a population has an unwanted effect: Over time, fewer adult fish get really big. If only the smaller fish reproduce\uff08\u7e41\u6b96\uff09, then future generations become smaller. This is an example of evolution\uff08\u8fdb\u5316\uff09 in action.\n\nOne scientist, Dr David Conover has spent the last decade studying the effects of the \u201ckeep the big ones\u201d rule and if they can be reversed\uff08\u98a0\u5012\uff09.\n\nTo set up his experiment, Conover and his team caught hundreds of silverside fish and divided them into six groups. For two groups, Conover followed the \u201ckeep the large ones\u201d rule and took out the biggest fish. For two other groups, he removed only the small fish.\n\nFor the last two groups, he removed fish at random (\u968f\u610f\u7684).\n\nAfter five years, he measured the fish in each group. In the two groups where the largest fish were regularly removed, the average fish size was smaller than the average size in the other groups. Here was evolution in action: If only small fish survive to reproduce, then future generations of fish will also tend to be small.\n\nFor the second five years of his experiment, Conover changed the rules and took fish randomly from each group. At the end of the experiment, he found that the fish that were in the \u201ckeep the large ones\u201d group for the first five years had started to get larger again, although he calculated it would take at least 12 years for the fish in that group to return to their original size.\n\nIn other words, it takes less time to shrink(\u53d8\u5c0f) than it does to recover.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: The underlined word \u201cit\u201d (Line 2) refers to \u201c\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Why do many people follow the \u201ckeep the big ones, throw the small ones back\u201d rule?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What did Conover find after the first five years of his experiment?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984: What is the author's intention in writing this article?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/ji3rc303317285.html"},

Amazing, but true. The sheep is15percent human and 85 percent sheep. The breakthrough(\u7a81\u7834)makes it possible to use animal organs in human bodies in the future. Professor Esmail Zanjani of University of Nevada, US, has spent seven years And over \\\\$9 million on the work. Zanjani took stem cells(\u5e72\u7ec6\u8dd1) from the human body and put them into the sheep while it was still in its mother's body. The stem cells made other cells that grew into organs. Zanjani believe that in the future such sheep might be used to help humans. Two months later a human-sheep is born, it has a liver(\u809d\u810f), heart, ling(\u80ba) and brain that are part-human. These organs could be used to help people in need of them. There are different opinions about his work, however. Some say that scientists don't have the right to create new creature(\u751f\u7269).

Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a hole on a hill from the English. He watched a spider(\u8718\u86db) making a web. Bruce is said to have got confidence from this and to have gone on to beat the English. Edison, too, the inventor of the light bulb(\u7535\u706f\u6ce1) , made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one.\n\nSo what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were you in high spir\u00acit then? What can you change so that things will go right the next time?\n\nSecond, is the goal(\u76ee\u6807) you are trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. Think about this question: \"If I am successful in this, where will it get me?\" This may help to prevent failure in the things you shouldn't be doing anyway.\n\nThe third thing to remember about failure is that it's a part of life.

They buy local food in supermarkets to save money and at the same time become friends with local people.\n\n Some people prefer adventure tours. Brave people may try bungee jumping from the bridge overlooking the Victoria Falls in Africa with only a rope around their legs.Some enjoy the challenge of rock climbing in the Alps in Switzerland.

An image I will never forget.\n\n Xavier from Portugal There were two dolphins below us swimming downwards. One stopped and looked back at me as if to say 'What are those strange beings?\" Fantastic!\n\n Interviewer Did you feel that your holiday helped local people and areas to keep their beautiful\n\nenvironment?\n\n Jane from New Zealand The hotel and the whale and dolphin watching comparues employ(\u96c7\u4f63) local people. They used to hunt those whales and dolphins, but now they can eam money from tourism and don't have to kill them. Not many boats are allowed at the same time so these animals aren't bothered. The boat companies also work to educate the local schools about the importance of protecting these wonderful creatures.\n\n Helen from England I am glad they are not killing the whales and dolphins any more, but the cars and boats use fuel which could cause pollution and make the sea less clean.\n\n Well, what do you think? Thousands of people visit the Forbidden City or the Great Wall of China every year. Do you think that's a good thing, or do you feel that China's important historical sites can be damaged?

In Beijing, only five days in January \n\n smog (\u96fe\u973e). What's the difference between fog and smog?\n\nAccording to scientists, fog is made up of tiny (\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684) drops of water and also ice particles (\u9897\u7c92) during very cold conditions. Smog is dirty air that looks like a mixture of smoke and fog, caused mainly by smoke from cars and factories in cities.\n\nAn official for the Ministry of Environmental Protection told Beijing News that PM2.5 pollution is the main problem with air pollution. PM 2.5 refers to pollution with small particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (\u76f4\u5f84).\n\nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, two main factors that cause PM 2.5 are motor vehicles and the burning of coal.\n\nPoor air has done harm to people's health. Children and the elderly are more at risk. A report from Beijing Children's Hospital shows that from January 5 to January 11, 2013, half of the patients in the hospital came for respiratory (\u547c\u5438\u9053\u7684) problems.\n\nTo respond to the air problem, the Chinese government and many Chinese people have started to take action. \n\nBeijing announced a plan to use clean fuel in government vehicles and plant trees. It asked citizens to set off fewer fireworks for the Spring Festival celebration. They suggested that cars with large emissions (\u6392\u653e) should be banned and factories should be closely watched. \n\nThree students from No. 4 High School in Beijing wrote a report to advise to fight the air pollution. \u201cWe hope more people will join us to protect our environment. With all our efforts, the blue skies will certainly return soon,\u201d said Shi Yucong, 15, one of the three students.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The underlined phrase \u201cwere free of\u201d means \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:According to the second paragraph, we can know \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Paragraphs 3 and 4 are mainly about \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is the best title for the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/bdw9c203315885.html"},

People didn't have modern machines. There were no modern machines, either. Life today has brought new problems. One of the biggest is pollution. Water pollution has made our rivers and lakes dirty. It kills fish and affects(\u5f71\u54cd) our drinking water. Noise pollution makes us talk louder and louder. Air pollution is the most serious kind of pollution. It affects every living thing in the world.\n\nThe world is not only hungry, but it is also thirsty for water. Only if we take steps to deal with this problem now can we avoid(\u907f\u514d) a serious worldwide water shortage later on. We all have to learn how to stop wasting our valuable water. One of the first steps is to develop ways of reusing it. But even if we purified(\u51c0\u5316) and reused the water, we still would not have enough. All we'd have to do is to make use of the vast reserves(\u50a8\u5907) of sea water in the world is to remove the salt.\n\nPaper comes from trees. We use a lot of paper every day. If we keep on wasting so much paper, there will not be any trees left on the earth. So how can we save paper? We can use both sides of every piece of paper, especially when we are making notes. We can choose drinks in bottles instead of those in paper packets. We can also use cotton handkerchiefs(\u624b\u5e15) and not paper ones. When we go shopping, we can use fewer paper bags. If the shop assistant does give us a paper bag, we can save it and reuse it later.\n\nInformation card\n\n", "answer": " \n\u5c0f\u98981:Water pollution\n\u5c0f\u98982:Noise pollution\n\u5c0f\u98983:Air pollution\n\u5c0f\u98984:Water shortage\n\u5c0f\u98985:Four\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/5zrwc303315975.html"},

She was told that her neighborhood used to be rich farmland planted with vegetables, corn and wheat. But looking at the new road, beautiful parks and supermarkets, to her surprise, Yang couldn't see any sign that food was once grown there.\n\n Yang is not alone. In recent years, many Chinese people have moved into new houses in country areas. Tall buildings have been built everywhere in the suburbs. The crops and fruit trees are no more grown there. But these changes have caused big problems too, warns Gan Zangchun, an official\uff08\u5b98\u5458\uff09at the Ministry of Land and Resources(\u56fd\u571f\u8d44\u6e90\u90e8\uff09\uff0e\n\n \"Chinese cities are growing very fast. This has made the area for farmland much smaller than before. This is really bad for the country's ability to grow food, not to mention the lives of farmers,\" said Gan last Monday.\n\n As the population of China is growing all the time, the country needs more farmland to grow food for the increasing people of China. But the recent rise in house prices has made selling land a good business. A lot of land has been used to build new houses for sale. So you can see, the shortage of the farmland is now a very serious problem.\n\n Pollution, such as, oil pollution, industrial(\u5de5\u4e1a) pollution and water pollution, which makes land useless, is another reason for the big drop in China's farmland. About 2.67 million square kilometers of land in China have been polluted and turned into desert.\n\n Today, can we use less farmland to grow enough food for more people? Of course not! The government wants China to have at least 120 million hectares\uff08\u516c\u9877\uff09 of farmland. Only in this way can we raise such a big population. But there are only about 121.8 million hectares left. \"It will be really difficult to reach the goal\", Gan said.

The second reason is size\u2014the universe is huge. \u201cTools like the Hubble Telescope(\u54c8\u52c3\u671b\u8fdc\u955c) have shown that there are at least 100 billion galaxies,\u201d says Shostak. \u201cAnd our galaxy, the Milky Way, has at least 100 billion stars.

Though there is no cure for colds, there are some suggestions for you to avoid getting a cold.\n\n First, you can avoid catching a cold by practicing healthy habits. Begin by eating healthy foods. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables and drink milk and juice. Other healthy habits include getting plenty of sleep at night and lots of exercise.\n\n Next, you should try to avoid contact with the viruses that cause colds. If you can, stay away from large crowds. When people cough(\u54b3\u55fd) and sneeze(\u6253\u55b7\u568f), the cold virus goes into the air. Do not share a drinking cup, fork, or spoon with someone else because that could spread the virus. Washing you hands is also a good way not to catch a cold. The cold virus may be on the things like telephones and money. Shaking another person's hand could even spread the virus. By washing your hands, you can stop the virus from infecting(\u4f20\u67d3).\n\n Following the suggestion above until doctors find a way to stop the viruses that cause colds.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: Each child in school catches\n\ncolds every year.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Though there is no cure, there are some\n\nfor you to avoid getting a cold.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:When people cough and sneeze, the cold virus\n\nthe air.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:You'd better not share a drinking cup with someone else because \n\n.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:By washing your hands, you can \n\n\u00a0from infecting you.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:Six to ten/ 6 to 10 \n\u5c0f\u98982:suggestions \n\u5c0f\u98983:goes into \n\u5c0f\u98984:that could spread the virus\n\u5c0f\u98985:stop the virus\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/uw6pc303316459.html"},

Do you use ten different words to do it? Can you do it in English, or do you have to use your first languages? Do you count on your fingers? Many people think that numbers and math are the same all over the world. But scientists have discovered that it is not true.\n\nPeople in different parts of the world use different ways to count on their fingers. In the United States, people think begin counting with their first fingers, which they extend or stick out. They then extend the rest of their fingers and finally the thumb(\u62c7\u6307\uff09to count to five. Then they repeat this with the other hand to get to ten. In China, people count by using different finger positions. In this way, a Chinese person can easily count to ten on only one hand.\n\nBesides ways of finger counting, scientists have found that cultures and languages are also different when it comes to numbers. Some languages have only a few words for numbers, and others have no words for numbers. A group of scientists studied aboriginal(\u571f\u8457\u7684\uff09people in Australia. These people don't have hand movements to stand for numbers. They don't even have word for numbers. However, they are still able to understand different ideas about numbers.\n\nIn a similar study, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology discovered that people of the Piraha tribe(\u90e8\u843d\uff09 in northwestern Brazil don't have words for numbers such as \u201cone\u201d or \u201cthree.\u201d.

They could learn, but it's not useful in their culture, so they've never picked it up.\u201d\n\nAlthough all humans are able to understand quantities(\u6570\u91cf\uff09,not all languages have numbers and not all people use counting. Number words in a certain language are a result of people needing numbers in their daily lives.

Can memory be improved? Luckily, hundreds of studies in the past 50 years have already given us a definite* answer.\n\n A healthy lifestyle keeps your brain young and memory sharp. First of all, it is necessary to have a healthy diet. Eating more food rich in B vitamins and Vitamin E, such as vegetables and lean meat, helps you have a better memory. Doing exercise can keep your brain alive, too. Proper exercise provides much needed oxygen for the brain. Running ,riding a bike ,swimming and even walking two or three times a week are helpful. Moreover, getting enough sleep is important. Only when your brain gets a good rest, can it work well. The healthier your lifestyle is, the better your memory will become, but do not expect a sudden change---it takes a long time to make a difference.\n\n Memory skills help you remember things better. The following three are the most widely used. Chunking* is a way of remembering a piece of information by cutting it into smaller ones. For example, to memorize a ten--digit telephone number 2127983630,you can divide the digits into three groups: first 212,then 798,and lastly 3630.This method is far more effective than remembering a string* of 10 digits. Organization means organizing information into groups of the the same kind. For example, trees, grass and flowers are plants; tigers, panadas, horses and cows are animals ,Imagery is remembering newly learnt information by using your imagination and connecting it with something that you are familiar with.\n\n However, memory skills will hardly work if you don't understand the information. What's more, only a regular review can make the memory last long. That is why students are always advised to go over what they have learnt after one day and then after three days, and then use it as regularly as possible.\n\n Human brains are like muscles that need nutrients and exercise to become stronger. If you make a few lifestyle changes and try some memory skills, you can certainly improved your memory.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:How many ways of keeping a healthy lifestyle are mentioned in the passage? \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which of the following examples is the use of the skill \u201corganization\u201d?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the passage, why should we review what we've learnt?\n\nTo use it better every day\u00a0\n\nB.To understand it in a better way\n\nC.To improve memory skills\u00a0\n\nD.To remember it for a longer time\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The passage is written to tell us\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\nnot everyone has a good memory\u00a0\n\nB. memory skills are not difficult to learn\n\nC. memory can be improved in some ways\u00a0\n\nD. it is important to have a healthy lifestyle\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/zxcsc203316498.html"},

It is an easy and direct way of making a contribution to social work and having a big effect on the community. It helps to save lives and helps those who are in need of blood because of bad conditions or the heavy loss of blood during operations or in accidents. \n\nYou are able to give or donate blood every three or four months. The doctors say it is not bad for your health. It is such a beautiful way of making a huge difference to someone's life and you can always be proud of it if you make a valuable contribution to society. Blood donation is not a big problem, but you need to keep a few points in mind.\n\nBefore donating blood, make sure that the ferrum(\u94c1) level in your body is high enough and for that you should take a healthy diet. Do not go for blood donation with an empty stomach. You should follow the correct process so that everything goes well. After having a balanced diet you will feel strong and comfortable to donate blood. You will not feel weak at the same time.\n\nFor required hemoglobin(\u8840\u7ea2\u86cb\u767d) in your body, drink lots of juice and other drinks. Fruit juice, such as apple juice is very good for increasing the blood level in your body.\n\nFor a good blood flow(\u8840\u6d41) in your body, drink at least 6-7 glasses of water every day. Completely avoid taking alcohol or caffeine a day before and after giving blood. Do not smoke cigarettes(\u70df) half an hour before giving blood.\n\nWhen you are going for blood donation, be relaxed, which helps keep the right blood pressure(\u8840\u538b). During the blood donation activity, you can breathe deeply and try to calm yourself down. Don't take part in some other activities.\n\nWhen you donate blood, you are making the effort to save someone's life. Blood donation is a very simple and fast process, but you need to take care of yourself after donating blood. Proper care helps to reduce side effects. The following are a few tips that will help you out.\n\nTake a rest for 15 minutes after completion of the donation. It helps you to feel relaxed and energetic.\n\nEat something and drink juice before leaving the blood donation center. Make sure that you have meals after donating blood. Smoking should be prevented for one hour after the process. Don't join in some activities at once, for example, driving.\n\nFinally, be proud of yourself because you have done a great thing in helping to save someone's life. Blood donation is a very important activity.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:purposes/importance/aims\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98982:social\n\u5c0f\u98983:loss\n\u5c0f\u98984:high\n\u5c0f\u98985:smoking\n\u5c0f\u98986:part\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98987:deep\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98988:until\n\u5c0f\u98989:immediately\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u989810:pride\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/qc8gc303314768.html"},

But that is not all the drug can do. In recent years, it has been used in other ways, too. Small amounts may help prevent a stroke or heart attack. One recent study showed that some people who took two aspirin pills a day had lower rates of colorectal cancer. And, some researchers say aspirin may help patients with colon cancer live longer. So, how did aspirin become so important? The story begins with a willow\uff08\u67f3\u6811\uff09\uff0e\n\n 2, 000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow. The tree contains a chemical called salicin. In the 1800s, researchers discovered how to make salicylic acid from the chemical. In 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later, it became the active substance in a medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The \"a\" came from acetyl. The \"spir\" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the \"in\" ? That is a common way to end medicine names.\n\n In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin prevents the body from making the natural substances called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and swelling\uff08\u80bf\uff09\uff0e Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys(\u80be) and blood vessels work well. So there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad.

Maybe you want to improve your health, become a more energetic person. Or maybe you want to improve your study, your relations or perhaps do some personal development.\n\nOne hour a day is not much. But if you read for one hour a day on weekdays, that's about 260 hours a year. That's a large number of books and a lot of useful advice.\n\nIf you follow the ideas, who knows what great things and feelings could come into your life. Also, all that information and advice will start to open up your mind. You will start to see more chances in your life.\n\nNow, you might think something like this:\n\n1. I really don't have the money...\n\nAnswer: Visit your public library or search the database(\u6570\u636e\u5e93). Or look for books that are used in places like amazon.com.\n\n2.

Will robots control our planet? Will computers become smarter than us? Not likely. But here are some things that scientists say are most likely to happen in 10 to 30 years from now, according to the BBC.\n\nDigital money\n\nWe used to pay with cash(\u73b0\u91d1) for everything we bought. Now when we use a credit card(\u4fe1\u7528\u5361) to shop online, money is spent without us seeing it. That means we are already using digital money. Using a card is much easier than searching our pockets for change. It is also safer than carrying a lot of cash.\n\nWhen ATM cards were first introduced, they were not accepted everywhere. But now it's hard to live without them. It's reported that people in Sweden completely stopped using cash last year, and the US might be next.\n\nBionic(\u4eff\u751f\u7684) eye\n\nIt's no longer something only in a science fiction movie. People who are blind may have a chance to get their sight back\u2014by wearing bionic eyes.\n\nA blind eye can no longer sense light, but a bionic eye can use a camera to \u201csee\u201d the environment and send data(\u6570\u636e) to the mind. Now the bionic eye only allows patients to see lights and unclear shapes. A high resolution(\u9ad8\u6e05\u7684) image could be just a few years away.\n\nSelf\uff0ddriving cars\n\nUnlike a human driver, a self\uff0ddriving car won't get distracted(\u5206\u949f) by phone call, the radio or something outside the window. Sensors(\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668) and cameras on the car would allow it to stick reduce the number of road accidents. You could even take a nap while the car driver itself. In the future, driverless cars would be widely accepted.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ has stopped using cash completely.\n\nWhat does the writer mainly tell us about digital money?\n\nWhich of the following statements is TRUE?\n\nFrom the report, we can learn some information about \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\uff0e\n\nWhich of the following can be predicted(\u9884\u6d4b) from the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/jb6rc203314927.html"},

Most tsunamis are caused by underwater earthquakes, but not all underwater earthquakes cause tsunamis. About 90 percent of all tsunamis take place in the Pacific Ocean, most of them are in Japan. A strong earthquake in the ocean near Japan caused a deadly tsunami on March 11,2011.

But it has the clearest and cleanest air. Amazingly, in this place, the sun sometimes hangs even in the midnight sky. This place is Antarctica (\u5357\u6781\u6d32): the coldest, windiest and harshest (\u6076\u52a3\u7684) place on the Earth. \n\n As the world's least-known place, Antarctica is of great interest to scientists around the world. In 1983, China joined the Antarctic Treaty (\u300a\u5357\u6781\u6761\u7ea6\u300b). The treaty made Antarctica a peaceful place for member countries to do scientific research. During 30 years, China has sent many scientists to Antarctica. They mostly look at the resources under the icy land and do research about climate change and marine (\u6d77\u6d0b\u7684) biology.\n\nAntarctica is a place with fantastic views. However, life there is very hard. Food is one of the biggest problems. Frozen (\u901f\u51bb) food which can be heated easily is people's daily food. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, scientists often eat dried or canned vegetables.\n\n Sleep is also troublesome. In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this period, Antarctica points to the sun and receives sunlight 24 hours a day. In order to get some sleep, scientists cover the windows with black plastic cloth to create \u201cnight\u201d.\n\n Working in Antarctica is dangerous, especially when meeting gale-force (\u4e03\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684) winds. Sometimes the wind is even stronger than a typhoon. It can easily blow people away. So there are ropes that connect buildings of some research stations. People can hold these ropes to keep their balance in forceful winds.\n\n What's more, communicating with others is difficult. Without cables and Internet in some research stations, two-way radios are the only tools to communicate. If people want to say hello to friends and relatives, they can use satellite phones.\n\n Although it is challenging to work in Antarctica, scientists' \n\n to learn about this mysterious land will never end.

What's more, fathers who spend quality time with their children may give their children happy memories which may last a lifetime.\n\n While each father is a \n\n person who educates children in his own style, good fathers have something in common.\n\n Good fathers attend their children's school activities. They also involve the children in their lives and the adult world by taking them to see the workplace, or by taking them when the car needs to be repaired, etc.\n\n Good fathers expect a great deal from their children, but also accept and support the unique individuals (\u4e2a\u4f53) that their children are becoming. \n\n Good fathers prefer explanations and reasoning to force.\n\n Good fathers know their time with children is really an investment (\u6295\u8d44) in them.\n\n Being an involved father is good for children and good for fathers.

Braincomputer interface(BCI) technology could help people with disabilities send commands to machines.\n\n Recently, two scientists, Jose Millan and Michele Tavella from the Federal Polytehnic School in Lausanne, Switzerland, show a small robotic wheelchair directed by a person's thoughts.\n\n In the laboratory, Tavella operated the wheelchair just by thinking about moving his left or right hand. He could even talk as he watched the vehicle and guided it with his thoughts.\n\n\u201cOur brain has billions of body cells(\u7ec6\u80de). These send signals through the spinal cord(\u810a\u9ad3) to the body part to give us the ability to move. But spinal cord injuries(\u810a\u67f1\u53d7\u4f24) or other conditions can prevent these weak electrical signals from reaching the body part.\u201d Tavella says. \u201cOur system allows disabled people to communicate with outer world and also to control machines.\u201d\n\n The scientists designed a special cap for the user. This head cover picks up the signals from the scalp(\u5934\u76ae) and sends them to a computer. The computer finds meanings of the signals and commands the wheelchair with an engine. The wheelchair also has two cameras that tell objects in its path. They help the computer react to commands from the brain.\n\n Prof. Millan , the team leader, says scientists keep improving the computer software that finds meanings of brain signals and turns them into simple commands.\u201d The practical possibilities that BCI technology offers to disabled people can be grouped in two kinds: communication, and controlling objects. One example is this wheelchair.\u201d\n\n He says his team has set two goals. One is testing with real patients, so as to prove that this is a technology they can get advantages from.

To avoid being fat, kids are told to keep off sweet food. However, a team of American scientists have discovered something new about eating sweet food.\n\n \"When we say some people 'sweet', we mean they are kind and friendly to us. Perhaps this word can help us learn more about people's feelings and acts.\" said Brian Meier, a scientist from the study team. \"Taste is something we experience every day. What we have done is to find whether we can know someone's character and behavior depending on their taste.\"\n\nIn one of their experiments, college students were asked questions about their character- whether, for example, they were soft-hearted or not. Then they were asked to make a list of their favorite food. According to their answers, the scientists found that the students who liked sweet food were nicer.\n\n In their another experiment, the scientists found that people who preferred sweet food such as cookies and chocolate were more willing to help other people in need, and those who ate non-sweet food such as chips weren't. For example, people with a sweet tooth were more likely to volunteer to clean up their city, visit sick children in the hospital and so on.\n\n The result of the experiments is that people's helpfulness or being nice has something to do with their taste for sweet food. So eating sweet food is a useful way to make people nice and helpful.

Of course, many of us know we may eat the whole thing in the end.\n\nIt isn't just girls. Most of us find it hard to say 'no' to something attractive, However, scientists now say that willpower is very important to success and a happy life.\n\nScientists in different countries have been studying the effects of willpower on people's lives for a long time. The results are similar, according to an article on February 7 in the Guardian, a famous British newspaper.\n\nIn one experiment, scientists told young children that they could either have a marshmallow(\u5706\u5f62\u8f6f\u7cd6) now, or two marshmallows in 15 minutes. Waiting obviously needed more willpower. Scientists then continued studying the children as they grew up. They wanted to see if some children always had stronger willpower. They also wanted to see how having stronger willpower affected their lives.\n\nYears later, scientists found that the children who had waited for two marshmallows were all healthier, happier and richer adults. Oppositely, the children who had shown weaker willpower at that young age were more likely to be in low-paid jobs, to be overweight, to have social problems.\n\nBut there is hope, Roy F Baumeister, an American social psychology(\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66) professor(\u6559\u6388) told the Guardian. Baumeister says we can train our willpower just like we train our muscles.\u00a0 Even a little practice can strengthen our overall self-control if we do it regularly.\n\nYou could start by making yourself stand up straight, speaking in complete sentences, or using a computer mouse with the other hand. Scientists have found that people who manage to change little habits often perform much better in laboratory willpower tests.\n\nLike muscles, willpower can 'get tired'. Don't try to do too many things at the same time, or when you don't have enough energy, for example when you are ill.\u00a0 If you already feel tired, you can try to recharge(\u6062\u590d) your willpower with a good night's sleep and by eating well.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The example of a girl eating cheesecake is used to\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What can we infer from the experiment?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following is NOT mentioned about the training of willpower?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is the article mainly about?\n\n", "answer": " \n\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/czcuc303315703.html"},

Also, it is connected by clean public transportation. Moreover, a green city is made up of facilities (\u8bbe\u65bd) that can save energy and reduce waste.\n\nAround the world, many cities and countries have done well to build themselves in a green way.\n\nChicago is well known for its green roof (\u5c4b\u9876) program. These roofs are covered with plants. The plants get a great amount of rainwater. Later, the water evaporates (\u84b8\u53d1) to help make the air cool and clean. So far, there are about 360 green roofs in Chicago, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nCuritiba, Brazil, has great transportation. It opened the world's first bus rapid transit (BRT) system in 1974. BRT runs on special lanes. This makes sure that buses are on time even in traffic jams. With the help of BRT, the city has the lowest level of air pollution in Brazil. Today, many other countries have copied BRT, including China and Mexico.\n\nSingapore is home to the first zero-energy building in Southeast Asia. Zero energy means a building is able to create more energy than it uses. Zero-energy buildings work with solar panels (\u677f) mainly on roofs. These panels can make electricity which powers the buildings. By 2030, Singapore plans to build 80 percent of its buildings like this.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:The theme of Earth Day this year is \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d. \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The article mentions that there is BRT in the following countries EXCEPT \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:From the passage, we learn that in the three cities \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The passage is mainly developed by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/x3/201408/k132x303314213.html"},

Not a problem! Throw on some running shoes and comfortable clothes and go for a run.\n\nOne of the coolest things about the sport of running is that you don't need expensive equipment(\u88c5\u5907). All you need is a good pair of running shoes and a safe environment. But just because you don't need much equipment don't be fooled into thinking the sport of running is easy. No one wakes up and decides to run a marathon without training. \n\nRunning makes your heart, lungs, and muscles stronger. It makes you know more about your body. Running also gives you energy by increasing your oxygen(\u6c27\u6c14) intake, so you don't get sick easily. It can even help you keep your mind on school work because exercise helps you to think more clearly.\n\nHow do you take part in the sport if you don't know much about it? Most schools offer cross-country and track programs, but there are also running clubs open to all ages. A simple Internet search can help you find some in your area. The programs show you how running can offer competition or just be for fun. They also teach runners to set realistic goals and take care of their bodies.\n\nRunners have great respect for each other because they know how difficult the sport can be. If you go to a race, you'll see people cheering for all the runners, from the first place finisher to the last place finisher. Running isn't always about how fast you are or how far you're going. It's about getting out there and doing it. Taking part is more important than competition, and effort is recognized over gift.\n\nIf you're looking for more than just a sport, running may be the perfect choice for you.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Which of the following is true?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What is the most important for runners in a race?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What is probably the best title for this passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/b8ywc303314370.html"},

Students are still taught to read notation(\u4e50\u8c31) so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that \n\n so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\n\nThe experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes \u2014 if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands(\u4e50\u961f), and writing their own music. \n\nThe key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it \u2014 not by notation, but by listening, imitation(\u6a21\u4eff) and meaningful experimentation. \u201cThe knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\u201d explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \u201cIn high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords(\u548c\u5f26) and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs. \n\nOne of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \u201cI've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\u201d said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \u201cOne of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students.

They are the beautiful half-human, half-fish creatures(\u751f\u7269). They have the head and body of a human and the tail of a fish. We also know that mermaids only exist in fairy tales. But where did all the stories about these creatures come from? If you have ever seen a manatee, then you might have an idea. \n\nManatees, which are also called sea cows, are mammals(\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269) that live in the sea. Since they are mammals, they have to swim up to the surface to breathe air. Many people believe that the story of the mermaid began with the ancient sailors who saw the manatees putting their heads out of the water to breathe. Because manatees are upright when they do this, it looks like they are standing. If a sailor saw a manatee doing this from far away across the sea, it is possible that the sailor would mistake the manatee for a creature that is half-human, half-fish.\n\nMermaids are described as having very long hair. This is probably because manatees like to swim up to the surface of the water in areas where there is sea grass. Manatees eat all kinds of plants in the sea, including sea grass. The sea grass around the manatee's head when they eat could create a picture of long hair.\n\nManatees also have powerful tails that are very similar to the fish-like tail of a mermaid. The sailors probably watched manatees come up for air and then swim back below the surface, using their paddle-shaped tails. This would explain why the sailors thought mermaids had fish-like tails.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What are mermaids?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Where do manatees live?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Do manatees need to breathe air out of water?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What do manatees eat?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Why did the ancient sailors mistake manatees for mermaids?\n\n", "answer": " \n\u5c0f\u98981:They are the beautiful half-human, half-fish creatures.\n\u5c0f\u98982:In the sea.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Yes.\n\u5c0f\u98984:They eat all kinds of plants in the sea.\n\u5c0f\u98985:When manatees were seen from distance, their heads looked human-like, the sea grass around their heads looked like long hair, and they swam with their paddle-shaped tails.\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/g8nlc303314373.html"},

You could have one lesson a week. If you didn't have private(\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684) lessons, you could still learn piano, but you would have to learn it by yourself. This was easy for some, but very difficult for most. However, with technology as it is today, there is at last another way that you can take piano lessons. You can take an online course.\n\nAn online course can save you lots of money. If a private lesson costs 30 or 40 dollars per week, just think about how quickly that adds up. You can take a complete online course in piano by spending a small part of the money that you would pay for taking weeks of private lessons. Also, private lessons are only usually one hour per week. If you have questions during the rest of the week, or if you forget something that your teacher said, you will have to wait for your next lesson to continue your learning. However, online piano courses are quite different.\n\nWith an online piano course, you can work at your own pace(\u8fdb\u5ea6). You can also take as many lessons per week as you'd want, or go back and listen to your last lesson if you have forgotten anything.

A man when he gets back who has not had a chance to go swimming for years can in the water. He can get on a bicycle after many years and still ride away. He can play catch and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother who has not thought about the words for years can teach her daughter the poem that begins \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\"\u3002remember the story of Cinderella or Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\n\nOne explanation is the law of over learning , which can be stated as follows: Once we have learned something, additional learning trials(\u5c1d\u8bd5)increase the length of time we will remember it.\n\nIn childhood we usually continue to practice such skills as swimming, bicycle riding, and playing baseball long after we have learned them. We continue to listen to and remind ourselves of words such as \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" and childhood tales such as Cinderella and Goldilocks. We not only learn but overleam.\n\nThe multinlicatinn tables(\u4e58\u6cd5\u53e3\u8bc0\u8868)are an excention to the general rule that we forget rather quickly the things that we learn in school, because they are another of the things we overlearn in childhood.\n\nThe law of overleaming explains why cramming(\u7a81\u51fb\u5b66\u4e60)for an examination. though it may result in a passing grade, is not a satisfactory way to learn a college course. By cramming, a student may learn the subject \u00a0well enough to get by on the examination, but he is likely soon to forget almost everything he learned.A little overlearning. on the other hand, is really necessary for one's future development.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the main idea of paragraph I?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The author explains the law of overleaming by\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:According to the author, being able to use multiplication tables is\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is the author's opinion on cramming?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c1/201408/hjbuc103313407.html"},

That's how millions of people start their day at Laughter Clubs around the world and many doctors now think that having a good laugh might be one of the best ways to stay healthy. \n\nThe first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995 by Dr. Madan Kataria. \u201c Young children laugh about 300 times a day. Adults laugh between 7 and 15 times a day,\u201d says Dr.Kataria. \u201cEveryone is naturally good at laughing---it's the common language. We want people to feel happy with their lives.\u201d There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1300 in the world.\n\nMany doctors are also interested in the effects of laughter on our health. According to a 5-year study at the UCLA School of Medicine in California, with laughing there is less stress in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%.\n\nSo what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to my nearest club in South London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class. To be honest, I wasn't interested in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking silly. Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \u201cho ho ho ha, ha, ha\u201d while looking at each other. However, our bodies can't tell the difference between real laughter and unreal laughter, so they still produce the same healthy effects. \n\nSurprisingly, it works! After ten minutes everybody in the room was laughing for real and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was surprised by how relaxed and comfortable I felt.

In London, some of this pollution came from factories, but much of it came from the coal (\u7164) that people burnt in their houses to keep warm during the winter. By the 1950s, London's smog problem had become so bad that the government decided to do something to clean the air. A new law was made and nobody could burn coal in any British city.

However, this problem is more difficult for Chinese cities to solve. One reason is that more of the pollution comes from the factories, rather than from coal burnt in people's houses. If these factories were closed, this would harm the economy and lots of people would lose their jobs. Another reason is that changing from coal to cleaner fuel (\u71c3\u6599), like gas, is quite expensive.\n\nHowever, the air in many Chinese cities is becoming cleaner and cleaner, as the government and people pay more and more attention to cutting down pollution.

Many landfills are set in poor neighborhoods.\n\nThe Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, New York, was the largest garbage landfill in the world.

You can use butter, honey or seeds. Put this feeding station in the places where there are lots of ants. Wait three minutes and count the number of ants feeding on each food. Count them every three minutes. Watch and find out!\n\nDo ants prefer sweet foods or less sweet ones? Here's test: Give ants a choice between full-strength honey and a honey-water mixture. Offer a few drops of each choice side-by-side. Then count the number of ants you see near each site every three minutes.\n\nHow Far Will They Go?\n\nWant to see how far ants travel to collect food? First find an ant nest(\u5de2) by following some ants when they carry food home. Now you know how far the ants traveled to your food station. Next, move the food station about one foot (30cm) farther. Keep moving it until the ants no longer show up.\n\nSpreading the News\n\nOnce ants find food they like, usually they try to get their nestmates to help. To find out how long it takes an ant to tell others there's food nearby, offer their favorite food and watch. After the first ant finds it, begin counting the ants at the food station every minute.

A 12-year-old girl was the only person to survive a 2009 air crash in the Indian Ocean. When a plane crashed over Sudan in 2003, only a 3-year-old boy survived.\n\nIt's a question that leaves safety experts puzzled.

A study of plane crashed conducted by Poplar Mechanics found that people sitting toward the back of the plane were more probably to survive than those sitting toward the front. A survey conducted by researchers at the University of Greenwich in the UK found that what matters most is how close you are to an exit(\u51fa\u53e3).

Trying to have a business by yourself can be stressful.

My goals for the class include a deep discussion of historical subjects and ideas.

She checks your fever, looks at your throat, and asks what you've been thinking about lately. When you leave, she gives you some medicine, but also a list of thinking skills that you are supposed to practice daily. She says that the way you think is causing some of your illness.\n\nDoctors and other scientists who study the human mind and try to explain why people act in the way that they do, called psychologists (\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6), are starting to believe it. You know that your brain (\u8111) is connected to every part of your body through your nervous system (\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf). Now scientists have proved that how you think and feel can have an influence on the health of your body.\n\nStress is caused whenever there is a problem or a change in your life. Of course, everybody has stress more or less; nobody's life is perfect. In fact, stress is necessary. Without stress, we would never learn anything or grow or change. We would probably be bored to death. But too much stress can hurt you. It can weaken your body's protection so that you are more likely to catch diseases. It can even make you more likely to have an accident.\n\nWhen you feel stressed, your brain sends a message to your body to produce a chemical called adrenaline (\u80be\u4e0a\u817a\u7d20). Adrenaline speeds up your breathing and your heartbeat. Today you have a different kind of stress. Problems like endless homework or troubles with your family are the kind of things you can't fight or run away from, so you don't use up all that adrenaline. It just stays bottled up inside you, and that's what can do something bad to you.\n\nWhat can you do about stress? First, you can try to find ways to change things so you aren't under so much stress. You can set up a plan to finish homework or go to a doctor or a psychologist to try to work things out with your family or your friends. But sometimes you can't change a stressful situation. Sometimes you don't even want to. \n\nThe link (\u5173\u8054) between your body and brain works in two ways. Your body can help your mind deal with stress. If you are under stress, you need to take especially good care of your body. It's important to get enough sleep and eat nutritious (\u6709\u8425\u517b\u7684) meals. Some people take a vitamin-mineral pill every day. Another thing that you can do is daily exercise. If you go walking or do aerobic dancing or work out at the gym (\u4f53\u80b2\u9986), you give your body a chance to burn up some of that adrenaline. Of course, a person who isn't used to much physical activity should start slowly. Anyone with a continuing physical problem should check with a doctor before starting any exercise programs.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:From the last sentence of Paragraph 5 we can infer (\u63a8\u65ad) that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What is probably the best title for this passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/kh1yc303312555.html"},

All you have to do is to send a few comets (\u5f57\u661f) in the direction of Earth, and its orbit (\u8f68\u9053) will be changed. Our world will then be sent moving into a safer older part of the solar system.\n\nThis idea for improving our climate comes from a group of US NASA (\u7f8e\u56fd\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u5c40) engineers and American astronomers. They say their plan could add another six billion years to the useful lifetime of our planet\u2014hopefully doubling its working life.\n\nThe plan put forward by Dr. Laughlin, and his colleagues Don Korycansky and Fred Adams, needs carefully directing a comet or asteroid (\u5c0f\u884c\u661f) so that it passes close by our planet and sends some of its gravitational energy (\u91cd\u529b\u52bf\u80fd) to Earth.\n\n\u201cEarth's orbital speed would increase as a result and we would move to a higher orbit away from the sun,\u201d Laughlin said.\n\nEngineers would then direct their comet so that it passed close to Jupiter (\u6728\u661f) or Saturn(\u571f\u661f). The comet would pick up energy from one of these giant planets. Later its orbit would bring it back to Earth, and the process would be repeated.\n\nIn the short term, the plan provides an ideal way to worldwide warming, although the team was actually worried about a much greater danger. The sun is certain to heat up in about a billion years and so \u201cseriously \n\n\u201d our biosphere (\u751f\u7269\u5708)\u2014by cooking us.\n\nThat's why the group decided to try to save Earth.\n\nThe plan has one or two worrying sides, however. For a start, space engineers would have to be very careful about how they directed their asteroid or comet towards Earth. The smallest miscalculation (\u8bef\u7b97) in orbit could fire it straight at Earth\u2014with deadly results.\n\nThere is also the question of the moon. As the present issue of Scientific American magazine points out, if Earth was pushed out of its present location, it is \u201cmost likely the moon would be stripped (\u5265\u79bb) away from Earth,\u201d it states. This would greatly change our planet's climate.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What makes the scientists plan to move Earth?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:If the plan is successful, Earth will have a working life of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ years.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What serious problems might the plan cause according to the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What does the underlined word \u201c\n\n\u201d mean?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/vla2c303312556.html"},

Every day hundreds of children in Africa die because they don't have enough to eat. There are two reasons. First, there is no work for the children's parents. Second, the governments in many African countries do not have the money to help the poor.\n\n Most African countries are poor. The land is not good for growing food and the weather is also bad for farming. The Feed Africa Fund spends millions of dollars every year on food for poor people in Africa. This money comes from people like you---- kind, \n\n people who do not want to see children die from hunger.\n\n Every dollar you give this evening will go to the Feed Africa Fund. Just one dollar can buy enough food to feed a family of four for three days. Think about it: only one dollar can feed four people for three days.\n\n How much do you spend on food every day? Ten dollars? Twenty dollars? I am sure you can spend a little less on your own food so that you have a few dollars for the Feed Africa Fund.\n\n Please be kind and generous!

Goal setting is used by top sports players, successful business people and achievers in all fields. Before you set personal goals, think about what you want to achieve with your life.\n\nTry to set goals in some of the following categories (\u7c7b\u522b).\n\nTo help make the process (\u8fc7\u7a0b) more manageable, divide your goals into smaller tasks. For example, if you want to reach a main goal in five years, set a three-year goal, a one-year goal, a three-month goal and a one-month goal. Then create a daily To-Do List of things that you should do today. When a goal is achieved, take the time to enjoy your success.

Her phone showed that during the night, Priedeman had read a text message from her friend. She did it while she was fast asleep.\n\n Reading and sending text messages while asleep\u2014called \u201csleep texting\u201d\u2014is an unusual sleep behaviour, similar to sleepwalking. It's also a growing concern(\u5173\u5fc3\u7684\u4e8b) among doctors: young people can't live without their cell phones.\n\n One in three teenagers sends more than 100 text messages a day, according to the Pew Internet \\& American Life Project. And at least four out of five teenagers said they sleep with their phone on or near their bed.\n\n Elizabeth Dowdell, a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, has studied sleeping texting. She said that having a phone nearby all night is a big part of the problem. \n\nAndrew Stiehm, a sleep medicine expert with Allina Health in Minnesota, agrees. It's possible for the part of the brain that controls motor skills (\u52a8\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd) to wake up, while the part of the brain that controls memory and judgment(\u5224\u65ad) may be still asleep.

Computer networks(\u7f51\u7edc)didn't work well. If one computer in the network broke down, then the whole network stopped. So a new network system(\u7cfb\u7edf) had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers. If part of the network was not working, information could be sent through another part. In this way computer network system would keep on working all the time \u3002\n\n At first the Internet was only used by the government (\u653f\u5e9c), but in the early 1970s; universities, hospitals and banks were allowed to use it, too. However, computers were still very expensive and yet Internet was difficult to use. By the start of the 1990s, computers became cheaper and easier to use. Scientists had also developed (\u5f00\u53d1) software (\u8f6f\u4ef6) that made \"surfing\" the Internet easier.\n\nToday it is easy to get online and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day.

Among them are many kinds of useful ways are well as taking special care of your health.\n\nIt is important that you make yourself excited to make your memory more active. You can do this by doing some new activities and by changing your daily habits. Learning a new skill helps your brain\uff08\u5927\u8111\uff09to develop. When trying to remember something, you should pay special attention to the most important things about it .Do not allow other thoughts to enter your mind because this will reduce your chances of making right memories.\n\nAn excellent way to help memory is to connect information with pictures. Try to see the pictures in your mind. Taking notes and keeping a diary will also be helpful.\n\nHealthy food and plenty of vitamins are necessary for your memory to work well. Drinking a lot of water also helps keep your memory. You must allow your brain to have enough sleep and rest. When you are asleep, your brain stores memory. Not enough sleep can cause problems with storing information .And being tired will also stop you from being able to think clearly and well.\n\nIn order to keep your mind on your work, you must be free from worry.

Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%.\n\nSo what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to the nearest club in the south of London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class. I had no interest in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking stupid (\u611a\u8822\u7684). Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands (\u62cd\u624b) and say \u201cho ho ho, ha ha ha\u201d while looking at each other. Although we couldn't tell the differences between \n\n laughter and real laughter, they still produced the same healthy effects.\n\nSurprisingly, it worked!

Most people, and many animals, like eating it. However, the only way for them to get that honey is to find a wild bees' nest and take the honey from it. Often, these nests are high up in trees, and it is difficult to find them. In parts of Africa, though, people and animals looking for honey have a strange and unexpected helper -- a little bird called a honey guide.\n\n The honey guide does not actually like honey, but it does like the wax(\u8721) in the beehives (\u8702\u623f). The little bird cannot reach this wax, which is deep inside the bees' nest. So, when it finds a suitable nest, it looks for someone to help it. The honey guide gives a loud cry that attracts the attention of both passing animals and people. Once it has their attention, it flies through the forest, waiting from time to time for the curious animal or person as it leads them tot he nest. When they finally arrive at the nest, \n\n reaches in to get the delicious honey as the bird patiently waits and watches. Some of the honey, and the wax, always fall to the ground, and this is when the honey guide takes its share.\n\nScientists do not know why the honey guide likes eating the wax, but it is very determined (\u4e0b\u51b3\u5fc3) in its efforts to get it. The birds seem to be able to smell wax from a long distance away. They will quickly arrive whenever a beekeeper(\u517b\u8702\u8005) is taking honey from his beehives, and will even enter churches when beeswax candles are being lit.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:\u00a0Why\u00a0is\u00a0it\u00a0difficult\u00a0to\u00a0find\u00a0a\u00a0wild\u00a0bees'\u00a0nest?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What\u00a0do\u00a0the\u00a0words\u00a0\"the\u00a0follower\"\u00a0in\u00a0Paragraph\u00a02\u00a0refer\u00a0to?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:\u00a0The\u00a0honey\u00a0guide\u00a0is\u00a0special\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0way\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0the\u00a0best\u00a0title\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0text?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/4wtmc303309542.html"},

The key here is goals.\n\nRespect Your Superiors (\u4e0a\u7ea7)\n\nYour boss is in his position for a reason, no matter what you think of him. If he's not the best one, be patient\u2014he'll be out of there soon. In the meantime, you have to respect him as your superior. That means following orders and closing your mouth. If you don't respect your boss, how will you expect the people under you to do the same?\n\nKeep Your Cool\n\nYou should never let your emotions (\u60c5\u7eea) control you. You should learn to keep calm. Never lose your cool when dealing in business, or it will ruin the whole thing.\n\nThe school of life can be hard, but if you're smart and play your cards right, you can come out with an A\n\n.

But TV seems to be doing OK. In fact, it's doing better than OK. Though the Internet is popular in the world, television continues to draw more and more people all over the world to many of its programs. Hundreds of millions turn to TV to watch World Cup soccer\uff0cOlympic Games and Discoveries.\n\nIn many places, increasing numbers of people can watch more TV than before. Ten years ago, only 44% of British homes had satellite or cable TV(\u536b\u661f\u6216\u6709\u7ebf\u7535\u89c6).Today, more than 93% do. More importantly, recent studies show that people are spending more time watching TV. Surprisingly, this is even true of young people between the ages of 8 and 18.Today's television industry has given so many choices. As a result, people can watch more of the things they like 24 hours a day.\n\nThe technology behind television has also improved. The big boxes that once filled living rooms are gone. Today's TV screens are thinner and thinner, yet the pictures are better and better. TVs are also moving from living rooms into kitchens and vehicles.\n\nFor years, TVs have also been used as video game players. But now they have been used in a few new ways. Many televisions can connect to the Internet and record programs. They also let people watch two programs at the same time. \n\nThe Internet is the main challenge (\u6311\u6218) for television now. But TV industry has shown that television will be important for years to come.\n\n\u30101\u3011\u5224\u65ad\u6b63\u8bef\uff08\u201cT\u201d\u8868\u793a\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u201cF\u201d\u8868\u793a\u9519\u8bef\uff09\uff1b\u30102\u3011\u5b8c\u6210\u53e5\u5b50\uff1b\u30103\u3011~\u30104\u3011\u7b80\u7565\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u30105\u3011\u5c06\u6587\u4e2d\u753b\u7ebf\u53e5\u5b50\u8bd1\u6210\u6c49\u8bed\u3002\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Studies show that people are spending more time watching TV than before. \u3010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u3011\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: Many televisions can \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ the Internet and record programs.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Where are TVs moving from living rooms?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98984: What is the main challenge for television\uff1f\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:T\n\u5c0f\u98982:connect to\n\u5c0f\u98983:Kitchens and vehicles. \n\u5c0f\u98984:The Internet.\n\u5c0f\u98985:\u5f53\u4eca\u6700\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u7684\u7535\u89c6\u5df2\u7ecf\u5904\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c55\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e4b\u4e2d\u3002\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/1l9ic303307338.html"},

The number of disabled people in India alone is probably more than double the total population of Canada.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, about one in ten people have some disability. Disability is not just something that happens to other people. As we get older, many of us will become less mobile (\u53ef\u52a8\u7684) , hard of hearing or have failing eyesight.\n\nDisablement can take many forms and happen at any time of life. Some people are born with disabilities. Many others become disabled as they get older. There are many progressive disabling diseases. The longer time goes on, the worse they become. Some people are disabled in accidents. Many others may have disability in the form of a mental illness.

What would you do if you could not see where you were going or could not hear the traffic? But there are other barriers: prejudice(\u504f\u89c1)can be even harder to break down and ignorance (\u65e0\u77e5) represents by far the greatest barrier of all.

He said he would make his study on the fish known to the public in an American magazine early next year.\n\nIn lab tests, Taylor said he found the fish can live up to 66 days out of water without eating.\n\nSome other fish can live out of water for a short period of time. The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time, while lungfish (\u80ba\u9c7c) found in Australia, Africa and South America can live out of water, but only in a not active (\u6d3b\u6ce2\u7684) way.

Yet, with modern fishing methods(\u65b9\u6cd5) , more and more fish are caught. We know that if too many trees are cut down, forests will disappear and nothing will grow on the earth. Yet we continue to use bigger and more powerful machines to cut down more and more trees.\n\nWe realize that if rivers are polluted with waste products from factories, fish will die. However, in most countries wastes are still put into rivers or the sea, and there are few laws to prevent this.

The reason for the difference is an atmospheric phenomenon (\u5927\u6c14\u73b0\u8c61) known as the jet stream (\u6c14\u6d41). The jet stream is a very high altitude (=\" above\" sea level) wind which always blows from the west to the east across the Atlantic. So the planes moving at a constant air speed go faster from the west to the east when they are moving with the wind than in the opposite.\n\nWhat would happen if the gravity on Earth was suddenly turned off?\n\nSupposing we could magically turn off gravity. Would buildings and other buildings float away? What happened would depend on (\u4f9d\u9760) how strongly the things were attached (\u5438\u9644) to the earth. The earth is moving at quite a speed, moving at over a thousand miles per hour. If you turn something around your head on a string, it goes around in a circle until you let go of the string. Then it flies off in a straight line. \u2018Turning off' gravity would be like letting go of the string. Things not attached to the earth would fly off in a straight line.

It will face challenges including temperature differences of more than 300\u2103 on the moon.\n\nYutu will do some research and look for natural resources (\u8d44\u6e90) for three months, while the lander will conduct an exploration at the landing place for one year.

Many children like to sit in front of the television instead of doing something else. When many experts (\u4e13\u5bb6) say that television is bad for children, some believe that television can really have a good effect on a child's life, if it is used properly.\n\nThere are many television programmes that both provide fun and education. Spending some time on these types of programmes is good for your child's development. The television can be more \n\n at teaching a child certain (\u67d0\u79cd) tasks.\n\nParents can also use the television to help children read. After watching an educational programme, your child may become more interested in a topic. Use that interest to drive your child toward reading.\n\nThe television can also help to make a family closer. After a programme ends, you can start a decision about it. This can help encourage a healthy family.\n\nThe television can introduce your child to new cultures. This can help your child learn a lot from them. \n\nThe television can also help build a bridge for difficult communication between parents and children. If a child refuses to talk about a topic with his or her parents, he or she is willing to talk about it with his or her parents after watching the programme about the topic. This is an example of television's role as a bridge to tough communication.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Which of the following is NOT true according to the first paragraph?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The television can be more \n\n at\u2026.Here \u201c\n\n\u201d means \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The television can help children \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following is NOT mentioned in this passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:This passage mainly talks about \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": " \n\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n\u5c0f\u98985:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/cy6zc303306224.html"},

Scientists say the results suggest that the heart is able to influence how the brain responds to a fearful event, depending on which point it is at in its regular cycle of contraction and relaxation.\n\n Sarah Garfinkel at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School said: \"Our study shows for the first time that the way in which we deal with fear is different depending on when we see fearful pictures in relation to our heart.\"\n\n The study tested 20 healthy volunteers on their reactions to fear as they were shown pictures of fearful faces. Dr Garfinkel said, \"The study showed that fearful faces are better noticed when the heart is pumping than when it is relaxed. So our hearts can also affect what we see and what we don't see - and guide whether we see fear.\"\n\n To further understand this relationship, the scientists also used a brain scanner(\u626b\u63cf\u4eea) to show how the brain influences the way the heart changes a person's feeling of fear. \"We have found an important \n\n by which the heart and brain \u2018speak' to each other to change our feelings and reduce fear,\" Dr Garfinkel said.\n\n \"We hope that by increasing our understanding about how fear is dealt with and ways that it could be reduced, we may be able to develop more successful treatments for anxiety disorders, and also for those for those who may be suffering from serious stress disorder.\"\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the finding of the study?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:When are people more likely to feel a sense of fear ?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The study was carried out by analyzing \uff08\u5206\u6790\uff09\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:Which of the following is closest in meaning to \"mechanism\" in Paragraph 6?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:This study may be useful to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:D\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/g9gsc303306337.html"},

If a person loses a lot of blood, he will become ill and may die. Blood is very important. People have always known that. At one time, some people even drank blood to make them strong! \n\nWhen doctors understand how blood goes around inside the body, they try ways of giving blood to people who need it. They take blood from the healthy people and give it to people who need it. This is called \" blood transfusion\uff08\u8f93\u8840\uff09\". The blood goes from the arm of the healthy person into the arm of the sick person. \n\nBut there are two problems. First, it does not always work. Sometimes people die when they have blood transfusion. Later, doctors find that we do not all have the same kind of blood. There are four groups\u2014O, A, B and AB. We all have blood of one of these groups. They also find that they can give any kind of blood to people of group AB. But they find that they must give A-group blood to A-group people and B-group blood to B-group people. I have O-group blood and the doctor told me that I could give blood to anyone else safely. \n\nThere is another problem. To give blood of the right kind, doctors have to find a person of the right blood group. Often they can not find a person in time. If they have a way to keep the blood until someone needs it, they can always have the right kind of blood. At first they find they can keep it in bottles for fifteen to twenty days. They do this by making it very cold. Then they find how to keep it longer. In the end they find a way of keeping blood for a very long time. \n\nWe call a place where we keep money a \"bank\".

Besides, there are many differences of a cell wall based on the kinds of plant. The following is meant to be what a plant cell wall is \u00a0like.\n\n The cell wall of a plant is on the outside of the cell membrane (\u819c). It is usually hard and cannot be bent easily, but the degree of flexibility (\u97e7\u6027) of the cell wall is different. It is based on the special use that the cell has in keeping the plant alive. Cells that make up the trunk of a tree are clearly less flexible than\u00a0 cells on a leaf.\n\n Cell walls act in many ways. They serve to protect the plant. They provide support, as well as help in the movement of chemicals and wastes into and out of the cell.\u00a0\u00a0More importantly, they control the water\u00a0 that goes in and out.\u00a0\u00a0Plants must have good water controlling systems (\u7cfb\u7edf), allowing them to keep water during dry seasons, and get rid of unnecessary water. Plants can't walk around to find water, so \u00a0being able to control water is very important.\n\nSo there you have it , what a plant cell wall is.

In 2008, the event turned into an international one, which \n\nhas drawn the participation of hundreds of towns and cities worldwide.

At that moment, mom's words came to my mind: \u201cEverything happens for the best.\u201d Dad offered me a car to look for a job. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport in Iowa. The program director, named Peter MacArthur, told me they had already hired an announcer.\n\nAs I left his office, I felt sad. I asked aloud, \u201cHow can a man become a sports announcer if he can't get a job in a radio station?\u201d\n\nI was waiting for the lift when I heard MacArthur calling, \u201cWhat did you say about sports? Do you know anything about football?\u201d Then he made me stand before a microphone and asked me to broadcast an imaginary game. As a result, I did a wonderful job and was told to broadcast Saturday's game!\n\nOn my way home, I thought of my mother's words again: \u201cEverything happens for the best if you carry on. One day something good will happen.\u201d\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:After the writer graduated from college, he tried to look for a job in \n\n\u00a0at first.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The writer couldn't find a job in Dixon because \n\n.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983: Which sentence below is TRUE?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The passage mainly tells us that \n\n.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/ngckc303316581.html"},

You don't have to suffer too much. Your destiny depends on yourself, not on any other factors.\n\nI know someone who says she just accepts what life gives her because she has done everything she can to improve it. Guess what her lifestyle is? She wakes up in the morning, goes to work, comes back home, relaxes, chats with people, watches TV, then goes to sleep. Next day, the same routine cycle follows. Huh!

You just don't sit around and wait for a million dollars to fall from the sky. You have to get off the couch, get your eyes off the TV screen, get your hands off the phone. Don't expect your luck to change unless you do something about it. If something goes wrong, don't just regard it as a little failure, but use it as feedback (\u53cd\u9988). Learn your lesson, make the most of the situation, and do something to solve the problem. It's not enough to think positively (\u79ef\u6781\u5730), you also have to act positively.\n\nIf someone's life is in the trouble, do you just hope that things will \n\n fine? Of course not! You get to do anything you can to save the person. So it is with your own life. It is not enough to hope for the best, but you have to do your best.

And the result can be what you don't want an end to the relationship.\n\nThe good news is that most troubled friendships can be mended. First, don't let your pride get in your way.

To err, or to make mistakes, is indeed a part of being human, but it seems that most people don't want to accept the responsibility for the problem. Perhaps it is the natural thing to do. The original quote about human nature went like this: \u201cTo err is human, to forgive, divine\uff08\u795e\u5723\u7684\uff09.\u201d This saying mirrors an ideal: People should be forgiving of others' mistakes. Instead, we tend to do the opposite \u2013 find someone else to pass the blame on to. However, taking responsibility for something that went wrong is a mark of great maturity\uff08\u6210\u719f\uff09.\n\nCommon sense is what we call clear thought. Having common sense means having a good general plan that will make things work well, and it also means staying with the plan. Common sense tells you that you take an umbrella out into a rainstorm, but you leave the umbrella home when you hear a weather forecast for sunshine. Common sense does not seem to be common for large companies, because there are so many things going on that one person cannot be in charge of everything. People say that in a large company, \u201cthe right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.\u201d\n\nAnd what is wrong with a society that thinks that making up a good excuse is like creating a work of art? One of the common problems with making excuses is that people, especially young people, get the idea that it's okay not to be totally honest all the time. There is a corollary\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u8bba\uff09to that: if a good excuse is \u201cgood\u201d even if it isn't honest, then where is the place of the truth?\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Which of the following is NOT based on common sense?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What can we infer from the last paragraph according to the writer?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What would be the best title for this passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/gkzzc303273784.html"},

Here are some advice for you to bridge the generation gap (\u6d88\u9664\u4ee3\u6c9f).\n\n Don't argue (\u4e89\u8fa9) with your parents. Don't get to your parents when you are angry. Your parents probably won't consider your ideas if you are shouting at them. And you can't express yourself well if you are angry. Go to someplace to \n\n Make sure you understand why you are unhappy. Then think about what you want to say to your parents. If you don't think you can speak to them at the moment, try writing a letter.\n\n Try to reach a compromise (\u548c\u89e3). Perhaps you and your parents disagree on something. You can keep your disagreement and try your best to accept each other. Michael's mother didn't agree with him about buying a motorcycle. They argued over it. But they finally came to a compromise. Michael bought the motorcycle, but only drove it on certain days.\n\n Of course, your parents might refuse to compromise on something. In these situations, it is especially important to show love and respect (\u5c0a\u656c) to them. Showing respect will keep your relationship strong.\n\n Talk about your values. The values of your parents are probably different from those of your own. Tell your parents what you care about, and why. Understanding your values might help them see your purposes in life.\n\n A good relationship with your parents can make you a better and happier person. It is worth having a try!\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:.

The middle school teacher in England who received this as homework couldn't either. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized\uff08\u7535\u8111\u5316\u7684\uff09communication found on Internet or mobile phones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the \"translation\" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great.\n\nSchoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted (\u9762\u76ee\u5168\u975e\u7684).\n\nEveryone should just relax, say linguists (\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6). They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says, \u201cKids who are now doing text messaging and e-mail will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.\"\n\nLinguist James Milroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception\uff08\u4f8b\u5916\uff09that young people are harming the language. And you can \n\n that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become \u201ccorrupted\u201d, and that they simply change to meet the new needs.\n\nHowever, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia Mcvey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to\uff08\u6c9f\u901a\uff09their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\u201d\n\nPerhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, \"I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun.\" \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:What is the main purpose of the first paragraph?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which of the following is TRUE according to\uff08\u6309\u7167\uff09the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The expression \"\n\n \" in Paragraph 5 means \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What can be the best title for the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/jm3wc303271543.html"},

Do you ever try to make your dream real?\n\nFollow Your Heart by Andrew Matthews, an Australian writer, tells us that making our dreams real is life's biggest challenge. You may think you're not very good at some school subjects, or that it is impossible for you to become a writer. Those kinds of ideas stop you from realizing your dream, the books says.\n\nIn fact, everyone can realize his dream. The first thing you must do is to remember what your dream is. Don't let it leave your heart. Keep telling yourself what you want every day and then your dream will come true faster. You should know that a big dream is, in fact, made up of many small dreams.\n\nYou must also never give up your dream. There will be difficulties on the road to your dreams. But the biggest difficulty comes from yourself. You need to decide what is the most important. Studying instead of watching TV will help you to get better exam results, while saving five yuan instead of buying an ice cream means you can buy a new book.\n\nAs you get closer to your dream, it may change a little.

I only knew that I had written it, and I could stop trying to make her into someone she was not.\n\nNow the present of her desk told, as she'd never been able to, that she was pleased that writing was my chosen work. I cleaned the desk carefully and found some papers inside--- a photo of my father and a one-page letter, folded(\u6298\u53e0) and refolded many times.\n\nGive me an answer, my letter asks, in any way you choose.

Art history provides information of different places and people.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nA study of art history might be a good way to learn more about a culture than it is possible to learn in general history classes. Most typical history courses concentrate on politics, economics and war. But art history focuses on much more than this because art reflects not only the political values of a people, but also religious beliefs, emotions, and psychology.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn addition, information about the daily activities of our ancestors---or of people very different from our own---can be provided by art. In short, art expresses the essential qualities of a time and a place, and a study of it clearly offers us a deeper understanding than what can be found in most history books.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn history books, objective information about the political life of a country is presented; that is, facts about politics are given, but opinions are not expressed. Art, on the other hand, is subjective: it reflects subjective emotions and opinions. The great Spanish painter Francisco Goya was perhaps the first truly \u201cpolitical\u201d artist. In his well-known painting The Third of May 1808, he criticized the Spanish government for its misuse of power over people. Over a hundred years later, symbolic images were used in Pablo Picasso's Guernica to express the horror of war. Meanwhile, on another continent, the powerful paintings of Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros---as well as the works of Alfredo Ramos Martins---depicted\uff08\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09these Mexican artists' deep anger and sadness about social problems.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn the same way, art can reflect a culture's religious beliefs. For hundreds of years in Europe, religious art was almost the only type of art that existed. Churches and other religious buildings were filled with paintings that depicted people and stories from the Bible. Although most people couldn't read, they could still understand biblical\uff08\u5723\u7ecf\u7684\uff09stories in the pictures on church walls.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBy contrast, one of the main characteristics of art in the Middle East was (and still is) its absence of human and animal images. This shows the Islamic belief that statues are unholy. Something else can be more religiously symbolic in history.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98981:F\n\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98981:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/0qugc303264223.html"},

Money and success alone do not bring lasting happiness. Aristotle, a Greek thinker, said, \u201cHappiness depends upon ourselves.\u201d In other words, we make our own happiness. Here are a few suggestions to help you be happier.\n\nThe first secret of happiness is to enjoy the simple things in life. Too often, we spend so much time thinking about the future \u2014for example, getting into college or getting a good job \u2014that we fail to enjoy the present. You should enjoy life's simple pleasures, such as reading a good book, listening to your favorite music, or spending time with close friends. People who have several close friends often live happier and healthier lives.\n\nAnother secret to living a happy life is to be active, and have hobbies where you forget your problems and time. Many people experience this dancing, or playing a sport, such as swimming. You can forget about your problems, and only think about the activity. Finally, many people find happiness in helping others. Studies show that people feel good when they spend their time helping others. If you want to feel happier, do good things for someone. You can help a friend with his or her studies, go shopping to buy food for an elderly person, or simply help out around the house by washing the dishes.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: The best title\uff08\u6807\u9898\uff09of the passage is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:The second paragraph tells us that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The passage gives us \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ pieces of advice on happiness.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:The writer thinks that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:Which of the following is not mentioned in the passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98981:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/0mk0c303257119.html"},

I'd like to know each of you. I am sure we will enjoy working together. I am sure that the more we get together the happier we'll be.\u201d Her voice was so sweet and her looking was so friendly. Everyone believed what she said.\n\nShe told the girls and boys her name and wrote it on the blackboard. She told them some of the things she liked to do and she was hoping to do with them during the year.\n\nThen she said to the whole class, \u201cNow you know my name and the things I like. Next I want to know your names and the things you like. Then I will feel that I know you.\u201d\n\nCould you make friends by doing the same as this teacher did?\n\nOne way of getting to know girls and boys in our class is to know more about them. It is usual to be friends with those people who have the same interests with you. You can play the same games and go on journeys together. \n\nYou may find that some new comers in your class miss their old friends and feel strange and lonely. You can invite them to take a walk or to ride bikes with you. You will find many things in common to talk about.

Do they have any \u201csecrets\u201d to success? The answers to these questions can be found in US president Barack Obama's \u201cback to school\u201d speech. Here is an excerpt(\u6458\u5f55) from his speech.\n\nI know that sometimes, you get the sense that you can be rich and successful without any hard work\u2014that your ticket to success is through rapping (\u9976\u820c\u97f3\u4e50) or basketball or being a TV star, when chances are, you're not going to be any of those things.\n\nBut the truth is, being successful is hard. You won't love every subject you study. Not all the homework will seem completely important to your life right this minute. And you may not succeed at everything the first time you try. \n\nThat's OK. Some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who've had the most failures. JK Rowling's first Harry Potter book was turned down 12 times before it finally came out. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team, and he lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots (\u6295\u7bee) during his career. But he once said, \u201cI have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.\u201d \n\nThese people succeeded because they understand that you can't let your failures beat you\u2014you have to let them teach you. You have to let them show you what to do differently next time.\n\nNo one's born being good at things. You become good at things through hard work.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do that every day. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness; it's a sign of strength. It shows you have the courage to admit(\u627f\u8ba4) when you don't know something, and to learn something new. \n\nAnd even when you're struggling, even when you're discouraged (\u6cc4\u6c14), and you feel like other people have given up on you\u2014don't ever give up on yourself. Because when you give up on yourself, you give up on your country.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Why does Barack Obama mention (\u63d0\u5230) JK Rowling and Michael Jordan in the fourth paragraph?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which of the following statements is NOT true?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which of the following is the closest in meaning to the underlined sentence?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D  \n\u5c0f\u98981:C\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u5c0f\u98981:B\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/wmvqc303257670.html"},

No one wants to get up at four o'clock in the morning and fight to get a good deal (\u4ea4\u6613) on Black Friday ( the first Friday at Christmas time). It's surely very difficult to pick up the courage and get out there in the cold for a good deal. But sometimes it can be well worth. Many retailers (\u96f6\u552e\u5546) offer \n\n all through the day. Some even offer online Black Friday specials, so we may still be able to get a great deal on Black Friday. \n\nRead advertisements regularly. Once the Christmas shopping season is coming, retailers will be hungry for business. They will try their best to get us into the store. Please read the weekly advertisements of sales among the major retailers from time to time. We may be lucky enough to find different prices for the same thing in different shops.\n\nShop online. Some of us don't like running from store to store to get the best price on the perfect gift. Some of us don't like to go out in the cold at all, and then, we can do online shopping. \n\nThe world of online shopping makes it possible for us to visit all the major retailers and some \n\nspecialty stores on the Internet. We can find exactly what we are looking for at the best possible price without even having to leave the house. With traditional Christmas shopping, it will always take us a long time to wait if we want to get the perfect gift. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981: The underlined word \u201c\n\n\u201d in Paragraph 2 means\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:We can have more choices to get a good deal \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98983:In this passage the writer wants to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n\u5c0f\u98984: From the passage we can infer (\u63a8\u65ad) that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. \n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98981:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/x3eqc303260486.html"},

The third Saturday in December Mark said he had made his list and had twenty dollars in his pocket.\n\nI drove him to a nearby supermarket. Mark picked up a hand basket and went in while I wailed and watched in the car. It took Mark over 45 minutes to choose his presents. Finally he came to the checkout counter (\u4ea4\u6b3e\u5904) and reached into his pocket for his money. It was not there! There was a hole in his pocket, but no money. Mark stood there holding his basket, tears falling down his face.\n\nThen a surprising thing happened. A woman came up to Mark and took him in her arms. \"You would help me a lot if you let me pay for you,\" said the woman. \"It would be the most wonderful gift you could give me. I only ask that one day you will pass it on. When you grow up, I would like you to find someone you can help. When you help others, I know you will feel as good about it as I do no.\"\n\nMark took the money, dried his tears and ran back to the checkout counter as fast as he could. That year we all enjoyed our gifts almost as much as Mm-k enjoyed giving them to us.\n\nI would like to say \"thank you\" to that very kind woman, and tell her that four years later, Mark went house to house collecting blankets (\u6bef\u5b50) and clothes for the homeless people in the fire.

Food.\n\nIt's always a practical idea to keep a supply of non-perishable(\u4e0d\u6613\u8150\u70c2\u7684) food on hand. Have an enough supply of canned food, powdered milk, dried fruits, non-salted nuts and canned juices for at least 72 hours.\n\n3. Flashlights(\u624b\u7535\u7b52) and spare batteries.\n\nKeep a flashlight beside your bed, at your place of work, and in your car.

Most telephones will be out of order, so radios will be your best source of information.\n\n4. Clothes.\n\nIf you live in a cold place, you must think about warmth.

The most memorable and clearest dreams happen in the last stage of sleep (also known as REM sleep). The sleep cycle repeats about four to five times every night. So you can see how a person has several different dreams in one night. Most people only remember dreams that happen closer to the morning when they are about to wake up. That you can't remember those dreams does not mean they never happened. \n\n The stages in the sleep cycle are organized by the changes in different brain activities.\n\n Stage 1: You are entering into light sleep. In this stage, your eyes move rapidly. We call this NREM. The body gets relaxed and your body temperature lowers. Your heart rate lowers, too. The body is preparing to enter into deep sleep.\n\n Stage 2: Also characterized by NREM. In this stage, the body temperature and heart rate drop again. You are completely asleep.\n\n Stage 3: Still in the NREM stage, this is a deeper sleep still.\n\n Stage 4: In this stage of sleep, your eyes move back or forward. We call it REM sleep. This stage happens at about 90-100 minutes after the beginning of sleep. Your blood pressure rises, heart rate speeds up. The majority of your dreams happen in this stage.\n\n These stages repeat themselves throughout a night's sleep.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: Dreams can happen in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\nA.

We are taught at home and at school that using violence (\u66b4\u529b) is the\n\n\u00a0 least civilized (\u6587\u660e\u7684) way to solve problems. For example, last week I thought about hitting my friend \n\n\u00a0for winning a beautiful shell while we were playing at the beach. I talked with him instead and we came \n\n\u00a0to an agreement. If two adults had a disagreement, and if they used violence towards each other in order\n\n\u00a0 to win, is it all right?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When two countries disagree, they often fight a war. Why is using violence not okay at home, at school,\n\n\u00a0 or in your country but okay between countries? So many people have been killed because of wars, not\n\n\u00a0 only soldiers but ordinary people, even small children and babies. And refugees (\u96be\u6c11) exist, too. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A war is a great violence, like two people fighting over a shell, just much bigger. Adults say they are\n\n\u00a0 fighting wars in order to solve problems and make peace. But can you really \"make peace\" by killing so \n\n\u00a0many people? I don't think bombs (\u70b8\u5f39) can reach people's hearts and change them. Bombs can't \n\n\u00a0create love and caring, and that's what we need in the world. Why do adults use violence so quickly? \n\n\u00a0Why can't they use their wisdom (\u667a\u6167) and talk it over?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adults might say that things are not that easy. But they are the ones that teach us to be kind, not to hurt\n\n\u00a0 people, and not to kill.

A person who believes in himself will keep trying to reach his goal no matter how many times he fails. In my opinion\n\n ,\n\nthe quality of determination to succeed is an important one to have. Therefore, I believe that we should \n\nnever give up.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One reason is that if we give up too easily, we will rarely achieve anything. It is not unusual for us to fail \n\nin our first attempt at \n\nsomething new, so we should not f\n\neel disappointed and should try again. Besides, if \n\nwe always give up when we fail , we will not be able to develop new skills and grow.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another reason we should never give up is that we can learn from our mistakes so that we can not make\n\nthe same ones. If we do not try again, the lesson we have learned is wasted.\n\nFinally, we should never give up because as we work to reach our goals, we develop confidence, and this \n\nconfidence can help us succeed in other areas of our lives. If we never challenge ourselves, we will begin \n\nto doubt our abilities.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 In short, it is important that we do not give up when working for our goals. Whether we succeed in the \n\nend or not , we will learn something , and what we learn will help us to become better and more confident.\n\nFurthermore, if we give up , we have no chance of attaining our goals any more , but if we keep making \n\ngreat efforts, there is always a chance that we will succeed one\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topic: Never Give Up\u00a0 \r\n\n\nPossible meanings and the author's opinions\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 The words \" Never give up\" can\u00a0\n\n others or oneself and express one's \n\ndetermination.\n\n\u00a0A person who wants to\u00a0\n\nshould have the quality .

But this hobby sometimes has serious results-at least to the players. For example, when people play tennis, sometimes they hurt their elbow and in this way they develop \"tennis elbow\". Also it is easy to hurt knees in \n\na football game. These injuries happen while the player is having fun, but they still hurt. A few months ago, Kathleen\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simmons, who loves playing volleyball, hurt her knee in a volleyball game. Her doctor told her that she needed a very difficult operation (\u624b\u672f) or she might not be able to play again,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She felt very sad and didn't know what to do. Then Simmons learned about \"video operation\". With the help of this new science in medicine, doctors can now repair many injuries and get people back on the playing field and back to their jobs much faster. Simmons found a hospital that was using this new science and went to see the doctors there. The doctors told her the operation could help. For this operation, her doctor didn't have to open her knee.

It is \n\nnot because a person has money or good looks. A good friend should be kind and patient. For example, if you have a bad day, a good friend should listen to your complaints and do his or her best to help. To make a friend, you cannot be too shy. You should make each other happy and share your lives.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But things cannot always be happy. Even the best friends have fights(\u5435\u67b6). What should you do when you have a fight with your friend? You have \n\nto talk to him or her. When there is no one around, have an honest talk. If he or she doesn't want to talk, you could write a letter. There are three steps to \n\nbeing friends again:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tell him or her how you are feeling; say what your friend has done wrong, and explain why you did this or that.

You \n\nshould enjoy life's simple pleasures, such as reading a good book, listening to your favorite music, or spending time with close friends. People who have close friends usually enjoy happier and healthier lives.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The second secret of happiness is to be active. Many people go dancing or play sports. People can forget about their problems and only think about the \n\nactivity.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, many people find happiness in helping others. According to \n\nstudies, people feel good when they volunteer their time to do many \n\nmeaningful things for other people. If you want to feel happier, do something nice for someone. You can help a friend with his or her studies, go shopping \n\nto get food for an old neighbor, or simply help around the house.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now maybe you know how to find happiness!\n\n1.

You may think it's because you're tired. Or perhaps you've been told sleep is good for you. Yet no one knows exactly why or how people sleep.\n\nUntil the early 1950s, most scientists thought the body and brain rested during sleep. Then a scientist watched people sleep. He noticed that during periods of between 5 and 30 minutes each, sleepers' eyes made rapid movements, as if they were watching something. He called these periods REM sleep, for Rapid Eye Movement. Periods when sleepers' eyes did not move he called non-REM sleep.\n\nWhenever the scientist woke people during REM sleep, they were having vivid dreams. Measurements showed that sleepers' pulses\uff08\u8109\u640f\uff09went up quickly during REM sleep. Their breathing, heartbeat, and the blood going to the brain also increased. Far from being a time of rest, REM sleep is a time when the body is hard at work. Scientists still don't know the reason for this. Some believe REM sleep makes learning easier. Babies spend a lot of time in REM sleep. Because of this, some scientists believe that REM sleep helps the brain grow. Others think REM sleep is a time for the brain to empty the day's garbage.\n\nOne thing all the scientists agree on is that sleep is necessary. Without enough sleep, people make mistakes. Most major car accidents happen during the early morning hours, when people are sleepiest.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:During REM sleep, a person's breathing and heartbeat \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Which word in paragraph\uff08\u6bb5\u843d\uff093 means \u201ccolorful and lively\u201d?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:Which paragraph tells what happens when people don't get enough sleep?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is the main idea of the article?\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:You can decide from the article that REM sleep \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:D\n\u5c0f\u98984:B\n\u5c0f\u98985:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c1/201408/ap3vc103257170.html"},

How about starting a new country? Patri Friedman is \n\nplanning to do just that. He left Google years ago to set up the Seasteading Institute. And his dream is\n\n to build seasteads-----floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, what will life on a seastead be like? Probably a bit like life on a cruise liner ( \u6e38\u8f6e), but much \n\nlarger, with shops , gyms , swimming pools, schools and other areas. In fact , the early seasteads may \n\nactually be specially-rebuilt cruise liners. But as science advances, Friedman believes they'll become \n\nmore like floating cities, with several hundred people.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seasteading raises a lot of questions . First of all , how will the new countries make money? The \n\nSeasteading Institute has suggested several money-making ideas, including ocean-based theme parks, \n\ncasinos ( \u8d4c\u573a) and fish farming. There's also the questions of safety. With storms, typhoons and pirates( \u6d77\u76d7) , the high seas are a dangerous place. However, the Institute says that it can stand bad weather \n\nand prevent crimes with its well-designed systems.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, is this just a day dream? Well, maybe not. One of the people behind the project is Peter Thiel. \n\nHe founded PayPal and was one of the first investors (\u6295\u8d44\u8005) in Facebook. So far , he's donated \\\\$ \n\n500,000 to the project.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And Friedman isn't wasting any time .

My father died in a car accident, leaving my mother, my two younger brothers and I alone. At that time, I was a senior high school student. After my father's funeral (\u846c\u793c), I had no choice but to drop out of school and work in a factory.\n\nI really wanted to return to school and wanted to go to college, but I couldn't. I only hoped to bring up my two younger brothers. Life was not easy for me, for I can't afford their tuition (\u5b66\u8d39) even if I worked from day to night without stopping. Without my father's protection, I thought I was a slave (\u5974\u96b6) to the fate.\n\nLater on, something changed my life. I still remember that it was a rainy day. I put myself in the rain and walked slowly in the street.\n\nSuddenly the rain stopped! I raised my head and found \u201cthe sky\u201d was in fact a dark blue umbrella. Then I noticed a middle-aged man with one leg on crutch (\u62d0\u6756) standing behind me. He said to me, \u201cWhy not run without an umbrella? If you didn't run, you would get \n\n.\u201d\n\nThe man told me that he was promoter (\u63a8\u9500\u5458). He once dreamed of being a policeman, but an accident ruined (\u6bc1\u706d) his dream. Though his present job was not suitable for his legs, it was wonderful start to him. He was very happy that he didn't lose heart and still \u201cran\u201d on the road of life\u2026\n\nI was encouraged by the man's words. I went to a big city and I became an assurance representative (\u4fdd\u9669\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba). After two years' running, I did well and my family condition turned better little by little. Later I returned to school and succeeded in my entrance to university.\n\nLife is like this. When you are in rainy days in your life, if you couldn't find a way to prevent you from being wet, you would be overwhelmed (\u88ab\u5236\u670d).

You may feel lonely at break or lunchtime. You want to have new friends. but how do you make\n\nthem? Maybe it seems like everybody else already has their friends. But remember, there's always room \n\nfor more friends.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Start by looking around your classroom-think about which kids you'd like to play with at break. Look\n\nfor chances to say hi to them, smile, and be friendly. Offer to share something or express your appreciation \n\n(\u6b23\u8d4f) to them. Invite someone to play with you or say \"Do you want to sit here?\" in the lunchroom. When \n\nyou're at break,walk over to kids you want to play with act friendly, and say \"Hi, can\u00a0I play, too?\" or just \n\njoin in.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If you have trouble doing \n\n or if you're feeling shy, ask your teacher to help you make new friends. \n\nTeachers are usually pretty good at matching up friends. The best way to make friends is to be a friend. \n\nBe kind, be friendly, share, say nice things, offer to help-and pretty soon, you'll have one, or two, or even\n\nmore new friends. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You might still miss that special best friend. But when you see each other, you can share something you\n\ndidn't have before she left: You can introduce her to your new friends! \n\n1.

When you are poor, you can also say you are very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have more chances to challenge yourself. So you should not always say you are poor and you have bad luck.

They know there are persons who might like to control their lives, but they don't let this get in the way. They know they have their weaknesses, yet they don't blame themselves when they fail. Whatever happens, they have choice in the matter. They believe their dance with each sacred(\u795e\u5723\u7684)moment of life is a gift and that storms are a natural part of life which can bring the rain needed for emotional and spiritual growth.\n\nVictims and creators live in the same physical world and deal with many of the same problems, yet their experience of life is different worlds. Victims are easy to be in anger, guilt, and other emotions that cause others--and even themselves--to feel like victims, too. Creators choose love, inspiration, and other qualities which inspire\uff08\u9f13\u821e\uff09not only themselves, but all around them. Both victims and creators always have choice to decide the direction of their lives.\n\nIn fact, all of us play the victim or the creator at different points in our lives.

Another with the same experience may choose to first experience the sadness, then accept the loss and soon move on to be a powerful creative strength in his life.\n\nIn every moment and every situation, you can choose to have fuller, richer life by setting a clear goal to change the victim within, and by inviting into your life the powerful creator that you are.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: What does the word \u201c\n\n\u201d in Paragraph 1 probably refer to?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: What can we learn from the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:The examples mentioned in Paragraph 4 show that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What is the writer's purpose in writing this passage?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n\u5c0f\u98984:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/vf54c203319126.html"},

Do they have any \"secrets\" to success? The answers to these questions can be found in US president Barack Obama's \"back to school\" speech. Here is a small part of his speech. \n\nI know that sometimes, after watching TV, you may feel that you can be rich and successful without any hard work--that your ticket to success is through rapping (\u9976\u820c\u97f3\u4e50) or basketball or being a TV star. But when chances come, you may not succeed. \n\nThe truth is, being successful is hard. And you may not succeed at everything the first time you try. That's OK. Some of the most successful people in the world have had the most failures. JK Rowling's first Harry Potter book was rejected(\u9000\u7a3f)12 times before it finally came out. Michael Jordan lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots during his career (\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf). But he once said, \"I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.\" \n\nThese people succeeded because they understand that you can't let your failures beat you--you have to let them teach you. You have to let them show you what to do differently next time. \n\nNo one's born being good at things. You become good at things through hard work. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. \n\n Because when you give up on yourself, you give up on your country. \n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Why does Barack Obama talk about JK Rowling and Michael Jordan in the second paragraph? \n\n\u5c0f\u98982:Barack Obama believes \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ in his speech. \n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What does the underlined sentence mean? \n\n\u5c0f\u98984:What's the best title of this small part of Mr. Obama's speech? \n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:D\n\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98981:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/a04jc303264946.html"},

She began to tell me that her only \n\nson lived around the corner from her, but she had not seen him in five years. She believed that the pressure of\n\nthis caused greatly to her health problems. After hearing her story and putting on her socks, I asked if there \n\nwas anything else I could do for her. She shook her head and smiled.

Now, \n\n\u00a020 years later, I sit all the time in a wheelchair. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For as long as I could, I continued to see patients from my chair, but I had to give up my job when my \n\nhands were influenced.

If someone you face is more \"important\" than you,\n\n you may be afraid to do so. But, why should you?

Wang You worked\n\nin a small firm (\u5546\u884c) in Nanjing. The job was good and he didn't have to work for extra hours. However,\n\nhe felt the work was not exciting at all and the life was boring. So he gave up his job and went to Beijing \n\nin February, 2007. When he arrived in Beijing, he set his new goal as finding a good job.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nowadays more and more people want to live a better life. This fact shows that the society is making \n\nprogress and people's life goals have be- come more practical. One researcher says, \"Everybody has \n\nhis/her own life goal, which will be surely different from people to people. If one is poor, one's life goal \n\nwill be to earn more money; if one doesn't have a diploma, studying hard to get a diploma will become \n\nhis life goal; and if one doesn't have love, his life goal will be to look for it. \n\n.\" \n\n1.

When we face difficulties, a spirit of depending on yourself is more useful\n\n than crying for help. That's what Hong Zhanhui's story of growing from boy to man with family hardship tells\n\n us. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hong was born in 1982 in a poor family in Xihua County (\u53bf), Henan Province. When he was only 11, his \n\nfather became badly ill and one day he came back with an unwanted baby girl. A year later, Hong's mother left\n\n home. She no longer wanted to live such a poor life and face her sick husband. So everything hard fell onto the \n\nyoung boy's shoulders: to take care of his father and the sister Chenchen, and to go on to study. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although his life was hard, Hong didn't go away from his father and sister. He worked in part-time jobs to\n\n feed his family. He climbed tall trees to get birds' eggs for his sister. He walked two hours at weekends to the \n\nmarket to buy different things to sell around his school. A few years later, he studied at a college. To take care \n\nof Chenchen, he worked hard to rent (\u79df) a room near his college for her, and send her to school. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After Hong's story went public, he became a hero in people's eyes. But Hong refused offers from others. \n\nHe said he felt encouraged by kind offers, but he could depend on his own work. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through his hard life, he has grown up from boy to man.\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n1.

These dreams can be very big, such as winning the Nobel\n\n Prize. They can also be small. You may just want to become one of the ten best students in you class. Once\n\n you find a dream, what do you do with it? Do you ever try to make your dream real? \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Follow Your Heart by Australian writer Andrew Matthews tells us that making our dreams real is life's \n\nbiggest challenge. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You may think you're not very good at some school subjects, or that it is impossible for you to become \n\na writer. These kinds of ideas stop you from getting your dream, the book says. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, everyone can make his dream come true. The first thing you must do is to remember what the \n\ndream is. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don't let it leave your heart. Keep telling yourself what you want every day and your dream will come \n\ntrue faster because a big dream is, in fact, many small dreams. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n There will be difficulties on the way to your dreams. But the\n\n biggest difficulty comes from yourself. You need to decide what is the most important. Stud-ying instead\n\n of watching TV will help you to get better exam results, while saving five yuan instead of buying an ice-cream\n\n means you can buy a new book. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As you get closer to your dream, it may change a little.

For each promise, find out two or three ways to help you\n\n keep it.For example, if you think that Being Honest is the hardest promise for you to keep, one of the ways \n\nmight be \"Tell people about my promise so that I won't break it\". \n\nPart 3: Confidence \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Confidence is believing that you have the skills to do something.

He had been in the ruins (\u5e9f\u589f) for more than ten hours before he was found and saved out by the\n\n rescuing soldiers. Though weak and injured, the brave boy lifted his right hand above the head with difficulty \n\nand saluted (\u5411\u2026\u81f4\u656c) the soldiers around, which became the most moving moment in the disaster (\u9707\u707e). \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks to the experience as a reporter, I myself am getting braver and stronger.

Are you doing what you love? Are you living your passion? If not, why? I am guessing \n\nmost people will answer that question with \"I have a loan, a lover and three kids to support\". In the real \n\nworld people have responsibilities. They have to make sacrifices (\u727a\u7272). You aren't supposed to be happy \n\nwith your job but you do it because you have to. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With all due respect, they are wrong. You can take care of your responsibilities and be happy with your \n\njob. We spend over 1/3 of our day, at least five days a week performing or jobs. This is a lot of time to be \n\nwasted on something we don't enjoy, isn't it?

Fear of how others will react, \n\nfear of failure, and fear that they can't do it themselves. I think the first part is for people to realize that they\n\ncan conquer (\u6218\u80dc) their fear. You will fail at times and others will think you are crazy at times, but if you \n\nbelieve that you will succeed then you finally will. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I understand that it is not easy.

It means that you must have the \n\nability to love and accept yourself in order to form and keep satisfying relationship with others. Self-esteem \n\nmeans accepting yourself for who you really are, and believing that you are indeed a worthwhile person who\n\n is deserving of love and respect from others.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Self-esteem is our sense of how good we feel about ourselves. It is based on our judgment of ourselves,\n\n not on other people's assessment, but simply on our own. Our self-esteem is not dependent on our talent. \n\nSome very ordinary people feel very good about themselves, while other extraordinarily high achievers hold \n\nlow opinions of themselves. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Self-esteem is the primary key to long-term stress management. Why? The first three sources of stress \n\nare: predictable life event, unexpected changes and build-up of daily stresses. These are much easier to handle\n\n when we believe in ourselves. A positive, healthy self-esteem gives us the \"hardiness (\u5f3a\u5065)\" to deal with the\n\n difficulties of life, and to see them as challenges to be met, rather than threats to be feared.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The forth category of stress is entirely the result of a low self-esteem. It is the category of stress that is\n\n most common and tiring over the long run. This kind of stress cannot be overcome, or even changed, until\n\n the self-esteem problems that cause it are corrected. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Learning to love yourself for who you are is the key to overcoming stress. Self-esteem comes from the\n\n self, and cannot be promoted by others. A person who feels that his self-esteem comes from the approval \n\nof those around him or her is bound to self-destruct (\u81ea\u6bc1). One cannot keep the level of \"performance\" \n\nrequired to please everyone else, especially if that performance disagrees with who you are and is simply a \n\nfacade that makes you popular with the world. When the applause is gone, there is nothing left. Only those \n\nwho can feel the strength of knowing who they are and those who can feel good about that will survive the \n\nstresses of life. Self-esteem is the basis of contentment and positive living. \n\n1. According to the writer, what is self-esteem? \n\nA. A kind of positive lifestyle. \n\nB. The impression we have on other people. \n\nC. The sense of how good we feel about ourselves. \n\nD. Our understanding of how we are seen by others. \n\n2. What can help people overcome difficulties according to the passage? \n\nA. Getting help from friends.\n\n B. A positive, healthy self-esteem. \n\nC. Learning to love yourself for who you are. \n\nD.

It reminded me of something I was taught as a youngster: Life isn't \n\nfair. It's a \n\nr, but it's absolutely true.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the mistakes many of us make is that we feel sorry for ourselves, or for others, thinking that life \n\nshould be fair, or that someday it will be. It's not and it won't. One of the nice things about surrendering (\u627f\u8ba4)\n\nto the fact that life isn't fair is that it keeps us from feeling sorry for ourselves by encouraging us to do the\n\nvery best we can with what we have. We know it's not \"life's job\" to make everything perfect it's our own \n\nchallenge. Surrendering to this fact also keeps us from feeling sorry for others because we are reminded that \n\neveryone is dealt a different hand; everyone has his own strengths and problems in the process of growing up, \n\nfacing the reality and making decisions; and everyone has those times that they feel cheated or unfairly treated. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fact that life isn't fair doesn't mean we shouldn't do everything in our power to improve our own lives \n\nor the world as a whole. Instead, it suggests that we should. When we don't recognize or admit that life isn't \n\nfair, we tend to feel pity for others and for ourselves. Pity is a self-defeating (\u81ea\u6211\u632b\u8d25\u7684) emotion that does \n\nnothing for anyone, except to make everyone feel worse than they already do. When we do recognize that life \n\nisn't fair, however, we feel compassion (\u540c\u60c5) for others and for ourselves. And compassion is a heatfelt \n\nemotion that delivers loving-kindness to everyone it touches. The next time you find yourself thinking about\n\nthe unfair world, try reminding yourself of this very basic fact. You may be surprised that it can push you out \n\nof self-pity and into helpful action. \n\n1.\u00a0The words \"a bummer\" in the first paragraph probably means \\_\\_\\_.\n\nA. a chance \n\nB. a disappointment \n\nC. a choice \n\nD. an embarrassment \n\n2. Which statement is TRUE according to the passage? \n\nA. We cannot just feel sorry, but take actions. \n\nB. We may feel worse when we realize the unfaimess. \n\nC. Life will become fair someday through our great efforLs. \n\nD. Pity is a self-defeating emotion delivering loving-kindness. \n\n3. The best title for the passage is\\_\\_\\_. \n\nA.

For a long time, I dreamed of doing something in Western China and last year after I left my college, I became a volunteer (\u5fd7\u613f\u8005) teacher. It has changed my life completely!\n\nI traveled a long way from Yangkang Railway Station to a small village by bus in the noth part of Qinghai province. On my way there, I thought about the village, the school, the first day and\u00a0 the children there. However, my heart sank (\u6c89\u4e0b) when I arrived there. It wasn't what I thought of. It didn't look like a school at all! How small it was! The school had only three rooms, one for Grades 1, 2 and 3, and the other for Grades 4, 5 and 6. There was a third classroom for me.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe children welcomed me warmly on my first day. They asked me a lot of questions and I told them stories about myself and my life in Shanghai. The next day, I gave them a test to find out their level (\u6c34\u5e73). To my surprise, over half of the students didn't pass the test, but they all wanted to learn new things.\u00a0\n\nI spent many nights getting ready for the lessons, reading test papers and marking homework. I enjoyed teaching these lovely and hardworking children, and I could see that they were making progress (\u8fdb\u6b65) with my help. I have also learned a lot from them.

If the answer suggests they serve only their own fame, they may be famous persons but not heroes.\n\nA hero has a \n\n from the mountaintop. He has the power to move people. He creates new possibilities. Without Gandhi, India might still be part of Britain. Without Martin Luther King, Jr., Americans might take different buses, eat in different restaurants, go for walks in different parks, and shop in different stores because of the different colors of their skin. \n\nThere might be changes in society without a hero, but the speed of change would be rather slow.

The book tells us some useful skills, such as how to put what you have learned into \n\npictures of your mind to make your memory better.

Finally she stopped talking to most people and \n\nbecame very \n\n. We connect through listening. When we \n\n, they know we care.

Not long ago, I had one that I would like to share. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was going to Marblehead\u00a0\n\n\u00a0my sailboat team. The team was racing down the high-way\u00a0\n\n\u00a0we felt \n\nhungry. Luckily, we saw a rest area ahead. I had a brand-new (\u5d2d\u65b0\u7684) \\\\$20 bill. I was so\u00a0\n\n\u00a0because I had \n\nnever had that kind of cash before. But spending it on food seemed like throwing it away. We all rushed into the\n\npizza line. \n\n\u00a0I got a pizza and a drink, and walked to my table. About halfway through the meal, I \n\n\u00a0I had \n\nnot handed any money to the cashier (\u6536\u94f6\u5458). I had just walked out, and nobody had noticed. I felt terrible. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My conscience (\u826f\u5fc3) opened its mouth and swallowed (\u541e) me in one big bite. I couldn't get over it. I just \n\ncouldn't go back to the cashier and\u00a0\n\n\u00a0my stolen pizza. I was so upset (\u4e0d\u5b89\u7684) that I refused to give myself\n\nthe pleasure of an ice cream for\u00a0\n\n\u00a0that someone would say, \"Hey, Jeff. Why don't you use the change from\n\nthe pizza instead of that nice, new \\\\$ 20 bill?\" I was not so proud of my cash now.. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the next two years, whenever the \"pizza thing\" came to my mind, I would say to myself, \"Don't think \n\nabout it\u2026\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have learned two things from this \n\n. Maybe I was a fool giving in to my conscience, and being too \n\nstupid to have a free pizza. But the real\u00a0\n\n\u00a0is that even if you get away from what you have done, your \n\nconscience will catch up with you. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This goes with the saying, \"A coward (\u61e6\u592b) dies a thousand deaths, a hero dies one.\" I was a coward and\n\nhave felt terrible\u00a0\n\n\u00a0at least a thousand times.

This is why some friendships don't last long .To have a friend, you must learn to be a good friend. Learning to be a good friend means learning three rules: be honest; be generous; be understanding.\n\n Honesty is where good friendship starts\n\n Friends must be able to trust(\u4fe1\u4efb)one another. They should tell the truth. If you aren't honest, you'll lose your friend's trust. (1)\n\nGood friends always depend on one to speak and act honestly.\n\nGenerosity makes a friendship grow well. It means sharing. You do not have to give your lunch money or your clothes. Naturally you want to share your ideas and feelings. These can be very valuable to a friend. They tell your friend what is important to you. By sharing them, you help your friend know better. \n\n Sooner or later everyone needs understanding and help with a problem. Something may go wrong at school. Talking about the problem can make it easier to solve. Turning to a friend can be a first step in solving the problem. So to be a friend, you must listen and understand\uff0e(2)T\n\n Now, do you know what you should do if you want to be a good friend and keep your friends?\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:\u5c06(1)\u53e5\u8bd1\u6210\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:\u5c06(2)\u53e5\u6539\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u542b\u6709if\u4ece\u53e5\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u3002\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff1aWhat can be a first step in solving the problem according to the passage?\n\n\u5c0f\u98984:\u5728\u6587\u4e2d\u627e\u51fa\u4e0eBeing generous helps make a friendship go forward. \u610f\u601d\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u5199\u5728\u7b54\u9898\u7eb8\u4e0a\u3002\n\n\u5c0f\u98985:\u5728\u6587\u4e2d\u627e\u51fa\u6700\u80fd\u8868\u8fbe\u8be5\u77ed\u6587\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u5199\u5728\u7b54\u9898\u7eb8\u4e0a\u3002\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:\u4e00\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u90a3\u4e9b\u7ecf\u5e38\u8bf4\u8c0e\u7684\u4eba\u4e0d\u80fd\u548c\u5176\u5b83\u7684\u4eba\u76f8\u5904\u5f97\u597d\u3002\n\u5c0f\u98982:If you try to put yourself in your friend\u2019s place,\u00a0 you can understand the problem better.\n\u6216If you don\u2019t try to put yourself in your friend\u2019s place,\u00a0 you can\u2019t understand the problem better.\n\u5c0f\u98983:Turning to a friend can be a first step in solving the problem.\n\u5c0f\u98984:Generosity makes a friendship grow well.\n\u5c0f\u98985:Learning to be a good friend means learning three rules: be honest; be generous; be understanding.\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/fwwmc303305754.html"},

When you are in trouble at school, \n\nyour friends will help you: when you study hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of \n\nyour life and your health; when you get success, your friends will say congratulations to you; when you do \n\nsomething wrong, people around you feel unhappy, too. All these are your happiness. If you notice a bit of them,\n\nyou can see that happiness is always around you. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Happiness is not the same as money. It is a feeling of your heart. When you are poor, you can also say you\n\nare very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with \n\ndifficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have more chances to challenge (\u6311\u6218) \n\nyourself. So you cannot always say you are poor and you have bad luck. As the saying goes, life is like a \n\nrevolving (\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684) door.

By comparison, in America only 3 people in 100,000 reach 100. But these Caucasus people aren't alone. The Pakistani Hunzas, who live high in the Himalaya Mountains, and the Vilcabambans of the Andes Mountains in Ecuador seem to share the secret of long life too.\n\n\u3000\u3000These peoples remain healthy in body and spirit despite the passage of time. While many older persons in industrial societies become weak and ill in their 60s and 70s, some Caucasus people aged 110-140, work in the fields beside their great-great-grandchildren. Even the idea of aging is foreign to them. When asked, \u201cAt what age does youth end?\u201d most of these old people had no answer. Several replied, \u201cWell, perhaps at age 80.\u201d The very youngest estimate was age 60.\n\n\u3000\u3000What accounts for this ability to survive (live) to such old age, and to survive so well? First of all, hard physical work is a way of life for all of these long-lived peoples. They began their long days of physical labor as children and never seem to stop. For example, Mr. Rustam is 142 years of age. He remembers his life experience: the Crimean War of 1854; the Turkish War of 1878; the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. His wife is 116 years old. They have been married for 90 years. Mr. Rustam has no plan of retiring from his life as a farmer. \u201cWhy? What else would I do?\u201d he asks. Oh, he's slowed down a bit. Now he might quit (stop working) for the day after 6 hours in the field instead of 10.\n\n\u3000\u3000All these people get healthful rewards from the environment in which they work. They all come from mountainous regions. They live and work at elevations\uff08\u6d77\u62d4\uff09of 5,000 to 12, 000 feet(1,660 to 4,000meters) above sea level. The air has less oxygen and is pollution-free. This reduced oxygen environment makes the heart and blood vessel\uff08\u8840\u7ba1\uff09system stronger.\n\n\u3000\u3000Another factor\uff08\u56e0\u7d20\uff09that may lead to the good health of these people is their isolation. To a great extent, they are separated from the pressure\uff08\u538b\u529b\uff09and worries of industrial society.\n\n\u3000\u3000Inherited\uff08\u9057\u4f20\u7684\uff09 factors also play some role. Most of the longest-lived peoples had parents and grandparents who also reached very old age. Good family genes may, therefore, be one factor in living longer.\n\n\u3000\u3000Finally, although these three groups don't eat exactly the same foods, their diets are similar. All of them eat little animal meat. Their diets are full of fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, cheese and milk. They never eat more food than their bodies need.\n\n\u3000\u3000It is clear that isolation from urban pressure and pollution, clean mountain air, daily hard work, moderate diets, good genes, and a youthful approach to life all lead to the health and remarkable long life of all these people.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981: What is the main idea of this article?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: \u201cThe idea of aging is foreign to them\u201d means that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983: How do you think the writer feels about these long-lived people?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:C\n\u5c0f\u98982:D\n\u5c0f\u98983:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/m7a4c303285464.html"},

Time is something that we \n\ncan't see or touch, but we can feel it passing by. Time is always with us. When we are at table, time\n\npasses; when we play, time goes by unnoticeable. We always say \"Time is money\", but time is even more \n\nprecious (\u73cd\u8d35\u7684) than money, because when money is spent, we can earn it back. But if time is gone \n\naway, it will never return. So, some of us even say time is priceless (\u65e0\u4ef7\u7684). \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We should always remember: future is now. For us students, we should try our best to work hard in \n\norder to create a great future of our own.

And never put off what can be done today\n\ntill tomorrow. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we all know, \"Time and tide wait for no man.\" If you waste today, you will regret tomorrow.

I smoke twenty packets of cigarettes every week, and drink three bottles of wine every day. I eat hamburgers and chocolates whenever I want. I never eat vegetables. I never walk anywhere and I never play sports. I sit at home every day.\u201d\n\nAlicia was \n\n. She didn't expect the man to give her an answer like that. She wondered how the man got to be so old when he did \n\n\u00a0wrong. She thought he should be \n\n\u00a0and unhappy. Perhaps she was wrong. Maybe, she thought, people could live a long happy life \n\n\u00a0eating well or doing lots of exercise.\n\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cIt's my birthday today,\u201d said the man. \u201cI'm forty-seven!\u201d\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:B\n\u5c0f\u98983:C\n\u5c0f\u98984:A\n\u5c0f\u98985:B\n\u5c0f\u98986:D\n\u5c0f\u98987:B\n\u5c0f\u98988:A\n\u5c0f\u98989:B\n\u5c0f\u989810:A\n\u5c0f\u989811:C\n\u5c0f\u989812:A\n\u5c0f\u989813:C\n\u5c0f\u989814:D\n\u5c0f\u989815:C\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c2/201408/1dmyc203318277.html"},

Do I \n\n my notes even when there isn't a test?\n\n\u2605 Do I have a good place to do my homework?\n\n\u2605 Have I tried different ways of studying?\n\nIf your worry is about a fight you had, you might write down all the things you could do: write a note to him or her, invite him or her to a basketball game, say sorry to him or her, etc. Once you have a list of things you could do, you can choose the one that gets your friend back.\n\n3.

Each 1\n\n grade and 5\n\n grade, students learn the basics of economics and investing(\u6295\u8d44).\n\nThen in 6\n\n grade, they put what they've learned to work.

They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.\n\nIn 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company.

It's always good to try new things because when you are trying new things you are growing. If you never try anything new, how can you improve? How can you make yourself stronger? The simple answer is \u201cYou can't.\u201d Look around you. With very few exceptions(\u4f8b\u5916), either everything you see in your world or every single detail of every single thing is the result of someone trying something new\uff0e\n\nAnother good thing about mistakes is this: When you are making mistakes, you are learning\uff0eConsider this: Edison failed 10,000 times before he perfected the light bulb. When asked how it felt to fail that many times, he said that he hadn't failed 10,000 times, but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work\uff0e\n\nFinally, when you make a mistake you are much closer to success. Why? Because when all is said and done, you will have tried some numbers of things before you succeed\uff0eEvery time you make a mistake, you \n\n one of those things and are one step closer. But this all doesn't mean that you should go ahead without considering the consequences(\u540e\u679c) of a mistake. However, when you try something new you have to be willing to set some reasonable limits\uff08\u9650\u5ea6\uff09 so that in the event that it doesn't work out the way you want it to, you will be in a normal place to try again\uff0e\n\nWe all have limited time and money so don't blow them all on one problem. Realize that it probably won't be perfect the first time and deal with these resources(\u8d44\u6e90) properly so you can learn, make corrections, and try it again\uff0eIf you accept and use your mistakes in this way ,you can make great progress in your business and your career\uff0e\n\nThere is an old saying that goes, \u201cIf you're not making mistakes, you're not trying hard enough.\u201d\n\nSo go ahead and make mistakes.

A fashion usually keeps popular for 1-3 years and then is replaced by another fashion. Even though there are a lot of changes in fashion, most people do not easily hope for the changes.\n\nNowadays more and more young people prefer following the fashion. On this phenomenon(\u73b0\u8c61), different people have different opinions. It is held that one should follow the fashion so as not to be looked down or seem strange. But it is also held that one should have his or her own judgement(\u5224\u65ad).\n\nThose who hold the first opinion think that society is progessing and one should get used to the changes.

I had to get to church, so I cut the conversation short.\n\nThe call came at 4:40 pm that day: my father was in hospital in Florida with an aneurysm (\u52a8\u8109\u7624).

A good friend can help you study. You can have fun together and make each other happy. Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends. They will be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. How do I know when I have found a good friend? I look for certain qualities(\u54c1\u8d28) of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability(\u53ef\u9760).\n\nAbove all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener.\n\nAt the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults(\u8fc7\u9519) in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me.\n\nAnother quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me.\n\nThere is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun. We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like. We share experiences and learn from each other. A good friend has a good sense of humor, too. He likes to laugh with me. That is how we share in the joy of being friends.

The idea of spending two months in Argentina was exciting. But I was afraid of it. I had never been far from New England. What would it be like in a strange country? What about the language? The more I thought about it, the more the idea worried me. \n\nIn the end I \n\n the invitation. As soon as Ted asked somebody else to go, I began kicking myself. I had turned down something I wanted to do because I was afraid, and had ended up feeling depressed (\u6cae\u4e27\u7684) . That unhappy summer taught me a valuable lesson out of which I developed a rule for myself: do what makes you worried; don't do what makes you depressed. \n\nAt the end of my senior year, I began to think about becoming a writer. But my professor was telling me to aim at teaching. I hesitated (\u72b9\u8c6b). The idea of trying to live by writing was a lot scarier than spending a summer in Argentina. Back and forth I went, making my decision, unmaking it. Suddenly I realized that every time I gave up the idea of writing, that downhearted feeling went through me.\n\nGiving up on what I really wanted to do depressed me. Right then I learned another lesson. To avoid that kind of depression meant having to bear a certain amount of worry and concern.\n\nWhen I first began writing articles, I was frequently required to interview big names. Before each interview I would get anxieties (\u7126\u8651) in the mind and my hands would shake. One person I particularly admired was the great composer Duke Ellington. On the stage and on television, he seemed the very model of confidence. Then I learned Ellington still got stage fright and had anxietyattacks. I went on doing those frightening interviews. Then I realized that I was even looking forward to the interviews. What had happened to those anxieties?\n\nWell, in truth, the anxieties were still there, but there were fewer of them. I had benefited from a process of overcoming them. If you put an individual in an anxious situation often enough, he will eventually learn that there isn't anything to be worried about.

A morning or evening gratitude list, written each day, can do wonders for helping you feel grateful. \n\nTake care of yourself.\n\nIdentify\uff08\u8fa8\u522b\uff09 the small things in life that make you feel good, and do one daily. A short walk, a few minutes of writing in your journal, a short meditation, watching the sunset\u2026whatever, will improve your outlook on life. \n\nRead inspirational(\u52b1\u5fd7\u7684) material.\n\nIt helps to be reminded of positive thoughts and positive attitudes. Get a small book of positive, inspirational thoughts and keep it by your desk. Read one or two thoughts each day. \n\nIs the glass half empty or full? Life works better when the glass is half full regardless of your life status. \n\nNo matter how many wonderful things you do to create a positive, happy, satisfied life, you could still end up unhappy. Ultimately, happiness, gratitude, a feeling of satisfaction is a choice.

People sent us letters with poems, stories and pictures. The deep feeling that was shared through the response (\u56de\u5e94) surprised us. We compiled(\u7f16\u8f91)these letters into a memory book and amazed her with it on the morning of her birthday. \n\nThe unusual thing about my grandmother's friends was not the number that she had, but the connection they shared. In many ways this book of friendship was the greatest achievement of my grandmother's life. \n\nI believe that developing true friendships is one of the most important things that anyone can do in one's lifetime.

Most individuals are unaware that doing some exercise after work makes them more energetic since it increases energy levels.\n\n Wise use of free time does not mean getting an advanced degree, although the mental encouragement gained through education is unbeatable in keeping your mind active.

Other people may tell you what to do, but you should not listen to them. You must only do what you want. If you always wear clothes like your favourite TV star, you must stop doing so. Instead, become your own star and wear the clothes you want. You have to like your body, it says. If you don't, you will not take good care of it and won't stay healthy. The book also says that girls must start becoming more confident. If you are confident, you'll succeed in life. A good way to become confident is to realize that you are as clever as boys.

But sometimes it's not bad to make mistakes, and here is why.\n\n At first , mistakes are a clear sign that you are trying new things. It's always good to new things, because when you are trying new things your are growing. If you never try new things , how can you improve ? How can you create? The simple answer is, \u201c You can't .\u201d Look around you, everything you see is the result of someone trying new things.\n\n Another good thing about mistakes is this : when your are making mistakes, you are learning. Consider this\uff1a Edison failed 10,000 times before he invented the light bulb. When he was asked how he felt to fail that many times, but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work.\n\n Finally , when you make a mistake, you are that much closer to success. Why? Because you have said what you should say, and you have done what you should do. Every time you make a mistake, you are closer to success. But it doesn't mean that you can make mistakes without thinking. Instead, when you try new things you have to think them over, so that you can keep away from some unnecessary mistakes.\n\nWe shouldn't spend all our time and money on the only one way , but use them correctly. Because our time and money are limited. (\u6709\u9650\u7684)\n\nThere is an old saying, \u201c If you are not making mistakes, you are not trying hard enough.\u201d So go bravely and make mistakes.

You don't show your secret personality when you're awake because you can control yourself, but when you're asleep, your sleeping position shows the real you. In a normal night, of course, you often change your sleeping positions. The important position that best shows your secret personality is the one that you go to sleep.\n\nIf you go to sleep on your back, you're a very open person. You normally trust people and you are easily influenced by new ideas. You don't like to make people unhappy, so you never express your real feelings. You're quite shy and you aren't very confident.\n\nIf you sleep on your stomach, you are a person who likes to keep secrets. You worry a lot and you're always easily becoming sad. You never want to change your ideas, but you are satisfied with your life the way it is. You usually live for today not for tomorrow.\n\nIf you sleep on curled up (\u8737\u7f29), you are probably a very nervous person. You have a low opinion of yourself and often protect yourself from being hurt, so you are very defensive. You're shy and you don't usually like meeting people. You like to be on your own.\n\nIf you sleep on your side, you have usually got a well-balanced (\u5e73\u8861\u7684) personality. You know your strengths and weaknesses. You're usually careful.

Instead, she became interested in marathon swimming. \n\nFor ten years Nyad devoted herself to becoming one of the world's best long-distance swimmers. In 1970, she swam a ten-mile marathon in Lake Ontario, setting the women's record for the course. In 1972 she set another record by swimming 102.5 miles from an island in the Bahamas to the coast of Florida.

Though the span(\u8de8\u5ea6) of water is less than 100 miles wide, it is rough and dangerous. After battling(\u4e0e---\u4f5c\u6218) the water for two days, she had to give up for the sake of her own health and safety.

In my opinion, it's better to improve it. Compared with He Garden, the map on the back of the ticket for He Garden is much clearer, more detailed and more useful. However, in the room that has the picture of the family members, there is only Chinese, no English, so my advice is to add English in interesting places. I got lost in the Slender West Lake. I spent about 30 minutes just trying to get out of one area. I think they need more signs posted along the trails. I like the Slender West Lake best, as she is so pretty! The ladies that were sweeping were very sweet. They always smiled at me and said hello, so it was nice.\n\nTaking a taxi is the most efficient(\u6709\u6548\u7387\u7684) and quickest way to get around Yangzhou. I didn't have a problem getting to the places which I'd like to go to while using a taxi. The driver was very friendly. The fare isn't too high, either. But I didn't enjoy taking the bus. The bus ride to the Mastixia Bay (\u8331\u8438\u6e7e\u516c\u56ed) took long although I only had to pay one yuan. It was also hard finding where Bus 32 was. I tried asking some people in English but they couldn't understand me, so I had to ask in simple Chinese that I only know buy that still didn't work. I spent about one hour walking around the city to look for Bus 32. The tricycle(\u4e09\u8f6e\u8f66) was nice, but it was a little too expensive for a small distance.

If someone says or does something that we don't like, we should just be quiet and try to stay away from that person in the future.\n\n Why is Assertiveness important?\n\n If you don't know how to be assertive, you might experience:\n\n\u2022Depression - Anger, a sense of being helpless, hopeless, or of having no\u3000control over your life.\n\n\u2022Resentment - Anger at others for taking advantage of you.\n\n\u2022Frustration - Why did I allow that to happen?\n\n Most people find it easier to be assertive in some situations than in others. This\u3000makes perfect sense. It's a lot easier to hold your ground with a stranger than with\u3000someone you love. But the more important the relationship is to you, the more\u3000\uff49\uff4d\uff50\uff4f\uff52\uff54\uff41\uff4e\uff54 it is to be assertive. Assertive behavior leads to increased respect from others\uff01\n\n But before you decide to act assertively, you have to decide if you can live\n\nwith the results. Although assertive behavior usually will result in a positive\n\nresponse\u00a0 (\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u56de\u5e94)\uff0csome people \u3000might react differently.\n\n How to be effectively\uff08\u6709\u6548\u5730\uff09 assertive:\n\n\u2022Use \"I\" statements. Keep the focus on the problem you're having. \"I'd like to be able to tell my stories without interruption.\" instead of \"You're always interrupting my stories ! \"\n\n\u2022Use facts, not opinions. \"Did you know that shirt has a hole?\" instead of\u3000\"You're not going out looking like THAT, are you?\"\n\n\u2022Express ownership of your thoughts, feelings, and opinions. \"I get angry when he breaks his promises. \" instead of \"He makes me angry. \"\n\n\u2022 Make clear and direct requirements. Don't invite the person to say no. \"Will\u00a0 you please?\" instead of\u3000'Would you mind\uff0e\uff0e\uff0e?\" or \"Why don't you\uff0e\uff0e\uff0e?\"\n\n\u2022Keep repeating your point.

I'll send you a photo of him if you like, and I could show you how he helps me too one day. And so I thank you again for supporting \u201cAnimal Helpers\u201d.

And we usually think that people who are happy and successful are having fewer problems than us. Look at the successful people we often mention.

When I was seven years old, my family created one. First, we put clean sand in a thin glass box and put the ants into it. Soon they got to work making tunnels. I was amazed that each one knew exactly what to do. With my mom's help, I kept a record of what happened each day and named the ants. \n\nOne day when I had put my face close to the structure (building), accidentally I knocked it over, and all the tunnels fell in. Although the ants survived their earthquake, one by one they began to die. I was frightened as I watched them give up their tunnel-building to carry the bodies to a corner of the farm. My mother reported that the ants were dying of \u201cfrustration (\u632b\u6298)\u201d. They simply could not stand the reality that their tunnels had been destroyed. \n\nAlthough much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Over the years, I came to realize the ants have the spirit of teamwork. Working together, they were able to create an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work. Day in and day out, each worked at their task. The ant farm showed that teamwork and perseverance (\u6bc5\u529b) are indeed the keys to success. But there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently \u2014Adversity (\u9006\u5883) is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, humans cannot give up when they face disappointment. \n\nSo I try to live my life like those hardworking ants.

The idea was exciting. Then I had second thoughts. I had never been far from New England, and I had been homesick my first few weeks at college. What about the language? The more I thought about it, the more the idea worried me. \n\nFinally, I turned down the invitation. Then I realized I had turned down something I wanted to do because I was scared and felt depressed(\u6cae\u4e27). That experience taught me a valuable lesson and I developed a rule for myself: do what makes you anxious(\u7126\u8651); don't do what makes you depressed. \n\nIn my senior year, I wanted to be a writer. But my professor wanted me to teach. I hesitated. The idea of writing was much scarier than spending a summer in Argentina. Back and forth I went, making my decision, unmaking it. Suddenly I realized that every time I gave up the idea of writing, that downhearted feeling went through me.\n\nGiving up writing really depressed me. Then I learned another lesson. To avoid the depression meant having to bear much worry and concern.\n\nWhen I first began writing articles, I often interviewed big names. Before each interview I would get butterflies in the stomach. One of them was the great composer Duke Ellington. On the stage and on television, he seemed very confident. Then I learned Ellington still got stage fright\uff08\u5bb3\u6015\uff09. If Ellington still had anxiety attacks, how could I avoid them? I went on doing those frightening interviews. Little by little, I was even looking forward to the interviews. Where were those butterflies?\n\nIn truth, they were still there, but fewer of them. I had learned from a process psychologists\uff08\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\uff09 call \n\n. If you put an individual in an anxious situation often, finally there isn't anything to be worried about, which brings me to a conclusion: you'll never get rid of anxiety by avoiding the things that caused it. \n\nThe point is that the new, the different, is definitely scary.

Here are some pieces of advice on making friends with Americans:\n\n* Visiting places Americans enjoy: parties, churches, restaurants, parks and sports clubs.\n\n* Be willing to take the first step. Don't wait for them to get close to you. Americans in China may not know you speak English. They may be uncomfortable if they can't speak your language.\n\n* Use small talks to open the conversation. Ask them where they're from, why they come to China, etc. Remember: Be careful not to ask personal questions about age, salary and so on.\n\n* Show an interest in their culture, their country or their job. Americans like to talk about themselves.\n\n* Invite them to join you for dinner or just for coffee or tea. Try to set a specific \uff08\u660e\u786e\u7684\uff09time. Americans sometimes make general invitations like \u201cLet's go out for a dinner sometime.\u201d Often this is just a way to be friendly. It's not always a real invitation.\n\n* Don't expect too much at first. Maybe they're being friendly. But maybe they want to be your good friends.

A baby giraffe is born 10 feet high and usually lands on its back. Within seconds it rolls over its legs under its body. Then the mother giraffe rudely introduces its children to the reality(\u73b0\u5b9e) of life.\n\nIn his book, \n\n, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson.\n\nThe mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look. Then she puts herself directly over her child. She waits for about a minute, and then she does the most unreasonable(\u4e0d\u5408\u60c5\u7406\u7684) thing. She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling(\u56db\u811a\u671d\u5929).\n\nWhen it doesn't get up, the process is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important. As the baby giraffe grows tired, the mother kicks it again. Finally, it stands for the first time on its shaky(\u6447\u6643\u7684) legs. Then the mother giraffe kicks it off its feet again. Why? She wants it to remember how it got up. In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group, where there's safety.\n\nAnother writer named Irving Stone understood this. He spent a lifetime studying greatness, writing stories about such men as Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin.\n\nStone was once asked if he had found something that runs through the lives of all these great people. He said, \u201cI write about people who sometime in their life have a dream of something. They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere.

The unluckiest people in the world are those who have never discovered how satisfying it is to read good books.\n\nI'm very interested in people and finding out about them. Some of the most amazing people I've met could only\u00a0 be found in a writer's imagination, then in his book, and then, again, in my imagination. I've found in books new friends and new worlds.\n\nReading is fun, not because the writer is telling you something, but because it makes your mind work. Your own imagination works along with the writer's or even goes beyond his. Your experience, compared with his, brings you to the same or different conclusions, and your ideas develop as you understand his.\n\nEvery book stands by itself, like a one-family house, but books in a library are like houses in a city. Although they are separate(\u5206\u5f00\u7684), in some way they are connected with each other. The same ideas, or related(\u76f8\u5173\u7684) ones, appear in different places; the human problems that repeat themselves in life repeat themselves in books, but with different solutions(\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5) according to different writings at different times. Books influence each other. They connect the past, the present and the future and have their own generations (age groups), like families. Wherever you start reading, you connect yourself with one of the families of ideas, and in the end, you not only find out about the world and the people in it, you find out about yourself, too.\n\nReading can only be fun if you expect it to be. If you concentrate on(\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e) books somebody tells you \u201cought\u201d to read, you probably won' t have fun. But if you put down a book you don't like and try another till you find one that means something to you, and then relax with it, you will almost certainly have a good time \u2014 and if you become, as a result of reading, better, wiser, kinder, or more gentle, you won't suffer during the process.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Which of the following ideas may the writer of this article agree with?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982:What can we learn from Paragraph 4?\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What's the writer's purpose of writing this article?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:B\n\u5c0f\u98982:A\n\u5c0f\u98981:A\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c1/201408/fr91c103287838.html"},

If you drop it, it will jump back.\n\nBut the other four balls, family, health, friends and spirit are made of glass. If you drop one of these, they will be broken. They will never be the same. You must understand that and try to have the balance in your life. How?\n\nDon't look down on your worth by comparing yourself with others.

Hotels provide warm beds to allow guests a peaceful night's rest. Besides, some hotels offer guests special services such as newspapers to read in the morning, fresh coffee, and even breakfast. Hotel workers want their guests to feel warm and welcome when they stay in their hotel.\n\nOne hotel near the Arctic Circle, however, is different. This hotel gives its guests a cold welcome. The Ice Hotel, in Sweden, is all made of ice. The Ice Hotel might sound strange, but in some ways it is a special hotel. It has a front lobby where guests check into the hotel, plenty of rooms to sleep in, and even room service, which guests can use to have food delivered to their rooms. The Ice Hotel is different, though, because most of the items are made from ice.\n\nIt takes more than 30 tons of ice and snow to build the Ice Hotel. It melts(\u878d\u5316) in the summer and is rebuilt each winter. Different builders and artists create the Ice Hotel, so each winter this famous hotel has a new shape and design.\n\nThe effort of building the Ice Hotel is worth it, however. Walking into the Ice Hotel is like walking into a diamond. The walls reflect even the smallest bits of light. Ice pillars\uff08\u67f1\u5b50\uff09support the roof. The floor below shines like glass. Almost every inch of this hotel sparkles inside. Visiting the Ice Hotel is truly an unusual experience.\n\nTemperatures inside the Ice Hotel are usually below freezing. Guests wear warm jackets, hats, gloves, and thick boots. Even the owners of the Ice Hotel know that staying in a building with walls of ice four feet thick can be a bit cold. They have a solution though. The Ice Hotel has a sauna for its guests. A sauna is a room filled with steam, where guests can warm themselves. In a way, then, one could say that the Ice Hotel does give their guests a warm welcome after all.\n\n\u5c0f\u98981:Why must the Ice Hotel be rebuilt each year ?\n\n\u5c0f\u98982: From paragraph2 we can infer that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\n\u5c0f\u98983:What is the purpose of the writer writing the article?\n\n", "answer": "\u5c0f\u98981:A\n\u5c0f\u98982:C\n\u5c0f\u98983:B\n", "url": "http://www.mofangge.com/html/qDetail/03/c3/201408/33f5c303285440.html"},

Each September, just as the decreased heat of the sun suggests cooler days, Grandma requests (ask for something) my help in her tomato garden. I'm sure that she cannot pick tomatoes without my youthful eyes and quick mind. She says we need to examine each tomato and agree on its readiness for picking. While Grandma's request for my help in the tomato garden is always the same, her desire for my help seems to increase each year.\n\n\u3000\u3000Grandma has eyes for finding even the tomatoes hidden by undergrowth and other tomatoes. I, however, just turn circles looking for the ones I think Grandma will like. I spot what looks like a ripe\uff08\u6210\u719f\u7684\uff09tomato, head in its direction, and then get sidetracked by another that appears to be equally ripe. I usually end up watching Grandma and trying to stay out of her way, which seems the only way my eyes and mind are useful.\n\n\u3000\u3000There we are, lost in the tomato vines\uff08\u85e4\uff09. Grandma's eyes are always knowing, and they are no different in the vegetable garden. From afar she spots (notice) what looks like a ripe tomato. As she walks toward the garden, she evaluates the tomato for a second time, but from a different angle. I already know it will end up in the basket with the pile of others Grandma has carefully chosen. However, Grandma acts as if she needs a final look to be sure. She calls me to her side, kneels beside the vine while enjoying the warmth of the fading sunlight on her face, and grasps the tomato in her hand. She turns each round, red ball toward the sunlight before disconnecting it from the vine with a half-hearted smile.\n\n\u3000\u3000She then looks at me. I nod my head and smile. Grandma assumes I smile in agreement with her tomato selection.

The changes may seem difficult. \n\n\u3000Don't panic! You will deal successfully with them! You are a young adult now!\n\n\u3000\u3000With more responsibility, you will find more freedom to make your own choices. This is a time to be well informed about making choices. In this way you can make healthy balanced decisions. \n\n\u3000You may already know your career path or you may have no idea at all what you want to do. Both situations are fine! Work hard and the right opportunity will present itself to you.\n\n\u3000\u3000Young adulthood means greater freedom and more choices. \n\n\u3000But try not to shut your family out of your life. You should learn to think of others even though you are old enough to look after yourself.\n\n\u3000\u3000It is also perfectly natural at this time for you to spend more time with your friends than your family. Choose your friends wisely. A true friend will stand by you no matter what happens.\n\n\u3000\u3000This period is a part of the life cycle. There are some people who will be with you throughout life's journey. There will be some people with whom you part and go separate ways. Leaving school can be hard.

They can also help you s\n\n\u00a0\n\nmoney. When prices are listed, you can go to the store with the l\n\n\u00a0price. Ads also tell you when stores are \n\nhaving sales. However, some advertising can be c\n\n\u00a0or misleading. Sometimes the words sound good but\n\ndon't really tell you anything about the q\n\n of the product. At other times, the picture in an ad looks a lot\n\nbetter than the real thing. So you have to be careful.
